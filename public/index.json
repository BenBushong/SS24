That’s fairly short: there are ≈250 words on a typical double-spaced page. You must complete eleven of these in the course. I will drop your one lowest weekly writing score. Your actual prompt will be assigned in class, so you must login each day to ensure you get these assignments. To keep you on your toes, we will vary whether these are assigned on Tuesdays or Thursdays. Each week’s weekly writing will be due on D2L by 11:59pm on Saturday\nYou can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst data visualization you saw recently, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course, including:\n\rWhen is a link correlational vs causal? How can we still make useful statements about non-causal things?\rWhy do we visualize data?\rWhat makes a great data analysis? What makes a bad analysis?\rHow do you choose which kind of analysis method to use?\rWhat is the role of the data structure in choosing an analysis? Can we be flexible?\r\rThe course content for each day will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions. That would be impossible. They exist to guide your thinking and to make complex reading more digestible. The specific topic for each week will be assigned in class. (We can’t emphasize this enough.)\nThe TA will grade these mini-exercises using a very simple system:\n\r✔+: (9.2 points (115%) in gradebook) Work shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. We will not assign these often.\r✔: (8 points (100%) in gradebook) Work is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\r✔−: (4 points (50%) in gradebook) Work is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\r\r(There is an implicit 0 above for work that is not turned in by Saturday at 11:59pm). Notice that this is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. We’re not grading your writing ability; we’re not counting the exact number of words you’re writing; and we’re not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. We are looking for thoughtful engagement. Read the material, engage with the work and you’ll get a ✓.\nWeekly Writing Template\rYou will turn these reflections in via D2L. You will write them using R Markdown and this weekly writing template (right-click to Save Link As…) . You must knit your work to a PDF document (this will be what you turn in). D2L will have eleven weekly writing assignments available. Upload your first weekly writing assignment to number 1, your second (regardless of which week you are writing on) to number 2, etc.\n\r\rLabs\rEach week of the course has fully annotated examples of code that teach and demonstrate how to do specific tasks in R. However, without practicing these principles and making graphics on your own, you won’t remember what you learn.\nPlease do not do labs more than one week ahead of time. I am updating the assignments as the semester proceeds, and you may do an entire assignment that is completely changed.\nFor example, to practice working with ggplot2 and making data-based graphics, you will complete a brief set of exercises over a few class sessions. These exercises will have 1–3 short tasks that are directly related to the topic for the week. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. There will also be a final question which requires significantly more thought and work. This will be where you get to show some creativity and stretch your abilities. Overall, labs will be graded the same check system:\n\r✔+: (17.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Exercises are complete. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work on the final problem shows creativity or is otherwise exceptional. We will not assign these often.\r✔: (15 points (100%) in gradebook) Exercises are complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance.\r✔−: (7.5 points (50%) in gradebook) Exercises are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. We will hopefully not assign these often, but subpar work can expect a ✔−.\r\rThere is an implicit 0 for any assignment not turned in on time. If you have only partial work, then turn that in for partial credit. As noted in the syllabus, we are not grading your coding ability. We are not checking each line of code to make sure it produces some exact final figure, and we do not expect perfection. Also note that a ✓ does not require 100% success. You will sometimes get stuck with weird errors that you can’t solve, or the demands of pandemic living might occasionally become overwhelming. We are looking for good faith effort. Try hard, engage with the task, and you’ll get a ✓.\nYou may work together on the labs, but you must turn in your own answers.\nLab Template\rYou will turn these labs in via D2L. You will write them using R Markdown and this  lab assignment template. You must knit your work to a PDF document (this will be what you turn in). Your output must be rendered in latex. I do not accept rendering to HTML or Word and then converting to PDF.\n\r\rProjects\rTo give you practice with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete two projects en route to the overarching final project of the course. Both these mini projects and the final project must be completed in groups. I will assign groups after the drop deadline passes. Groups will be 2-3 people. You are allowed to form your own groups, but I will assign groups. More details will follow later.\nThe two (mini) projects are checkpoints to ensure you’re working on your project seriously. They will be graded using a check system:\n\r✔+: (55 points (≈115%) in gradebook) Project is phenomenally well-designed and uses advanced R techniques. The project uncovers an important story that is not readily apparent from just looking at the raw data. I will not assign these often.\r✔: (50 points (100%) in gradebook) Project is fine, follows most design principles, answers a question from the data, and uses R correctly. This is the expected level of performance.\r✔−: (25 points (50%) in gradebook) Project is missing large components, is poorly designed, does not answer a relevant question, and/or uses R incorrectly. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\r\rBecause these mini projects give you practice for the final project, we will provide you with substantial feedback on your design and code.\n\rFinal project\rAt the end of the course, you will demonstrate your skills by completing a final project. Complete details for the final project (including past examples of excellent projects) are here. In brief, the final project has the following elements:\nYou must find existing data to analyze.1 Aggregating data from multiple sources is encouraged, but is not required.\r\rYou must visualize (at least) three interesting features of that data. Visualizations should aid the reader in understanding something about the data that might not be readily aparent.2\r\rYou must come up with some analysis—using tools from the course—which relates your data to either a prediction or a policy conclusion. For example, if you collected data from Major League Baseball games, you could try to “predict” whether a left-hander was pitching based solely on the outcomes of the batsmen.3\r\rYou must write your analysis as if presenting to a C-suite executive. If you are not familiar with this terminology, the C-suite includes, e.g., the CEO, CFO, and COO of a given company. Generally speaking, such executives are not particularly analytically oriented, and therefore your explanations need to be clear, consise (their time is valuable) and contain actionable (or valuable) information.\r\rThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\nThe project will not be graded using a check system, and will be graded by me (the main instructor, not a TA). I will evaluate the following four elements of your project:\nTechnical skills: Was the project easy? Does it showcase mastery of data analysis?\rVisual design: Was the information smartly conveyed and usable? Was it beautiful?\rAnalytic design: Was the analysis appropriate? Was it sensible, given the dataset?\rStory: Did we learn something?\r\rIf you’ve engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.\n\r\rNote that existing is taken to mean that you are not permitted to collect data by interacting with other people. That is not to say that you cannot gather data that previously has not been gathered into a single place—this sort of exercise is encouraged.↩︎\n\rPie charts of any kind will result in a 25% grade deduction.↩︎\n\rThis is an extremely dumb idea for a number of reasons. Moreover, it’s worth mentioning that sports data, while rich, can be overwhelming due to its sheer magnitude and the variety of approaches that can be applied. Use with caution.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1693228632,"objectID":"3aa23ffb1eb3dedbe4d8a9c2165e2c58","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Weekly Writings\r\rWeekly Writing Template\r\rLabs\r\rLab Template\r\rProjects\rFinal project\r\r\rThis course is the capstone of the Data Analytics Minor in the College of Social Science.

For those concerned about basics of R, you absolutely must read this content and attempt the coding exercises. If you struggle to follow the content, please contact the professor or TA.\n\rIn this class, we will be using R software environment for all our analyses. You will learn R and data analysis techniques simultaneously. To follow along you will therefore need access to R. We also recommend the use of an integrated development environment (IDE), such as RStudio, to save your work.\nNote that it is common for a course or workshop to offer access to an R environment and an IDE through your web browser, as done by RStudio/Posit cloud2. If you have access to such a resource, you don’t need to install R and RStudio. However, if you intend on becoming a practicing data analyst, we highly recommend installing these tools on your computer3. This is not hard.\nALERT\nRStudio, the separate integrated development environment (IDE) commonly used to run R has re-branded. I haven’t the foggiest as to why. The name is now Posit, so if you clicked on a link that says RStudio and you got Posit, that’s fine.\n\rInstalling R and R Studio Posit and Review Resources\rBoth R and RStudio Posit are free and available online. If you have not yet done so, you’ll need to install both R and RStudio Posit. See the Installing page of our course resources for instructions. This will be part of your assignment for this week.\nI have created a video walkthrough for the basics of using R for another course, but it is useful here. You can see part A here (labeled “Part 2a”) here ] and part B here (labeled “Part 2b”) . You should already be at this level of familiarity with R, but if you need a review, this is a good place to start.\n\rThe (very) basics of R\rBefore we get started with the motivating dataset, we need to cover the very basics of R.\nObjects\rSuppose a relatively math unsavvy student asks us for help solving several quadratic equations of the form \\(ax^2+bx+c = 0\\). You—a savvy student—recall that the quadratic formula gives us the solutions:\n\\[\r\\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\,\\, \\mbox{ and } \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\r\\]\nwhich of course depend on the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). That is, the quadratic equation represents a function with three arguments.\nOne advantage of programming languages is that we can define variables and write expressions with these variables, similar to how we do so in math, but obtain a numeric solution. We will write out general code for the quadratic equation below, but if we are asked to solve \\(x^2 + x -1 = 0\\), then we define:\na \u0026lt;- 1\rb \u0026lt;- 1\rc \u0026lt;- -1\rwhich stores the values for later use. We use \u0026lt;- to assign values to the variables.\nWe can also assign values using = instead of \u0026lt;-, but some recommend against using = to avoid confusion.4\nTRY IT\nCopy and paste the code above into your console to define the three variables. Note that R does not print anything when we make this assignment. This means the objects were defined successfully. Had you made a mistake, you would have received an error message. Throughout these written notes, you’ll have the most success if you continue to copy code into your own console.\n\rTo see the value stored in a variable, we simply ask R to evaluate a and it shows the stored value:\na\r## [1] 1\rA more explicit way to ask R to show us the value stored in a is using print like this:\nprint(a)\r## [1] 1\rWe use the term object to describe stuff that is stored in R. Variables are examples, but objects can also be more complicated entities such as functions, which are described later.\n\rThe workspace\rAs we define objects in the console, we are actually changing the workspace. You can see all the variables saved in your workspace by typing:\nls()\r## [1] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot; \u0026quot;select\u0026quot;\r(Note that one of my variables listed above comes from generating the graphs above). In RStudio Posit, the Environment tab shows the values:\nWe should see a, b, and c. If you try to recover the value of a variable that is not in your workspace, you receive an error. For example, if you type x you will receive the following message: Error: object 'x' not found.\nNow since these values are saved in variables, to obtain a solution to our equation, we use the quadratic formula:\n(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )\r## [1] 0.618034\r(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )\r## [1] -1.618034\r\rFunctions\rOnce you define variables, the data analysis process can usually be described as a series of functions applied to the data. R includes several zillion predefined functions and most of the analysis pipelines we construct make extensive use of the built-in functions. But R’s power comes from its scalability. We have access to (nearly) infinite functions via install.packages and library. As we go through the course, we will carefully note new functions we bring to each problem. For now, though, we will stick to the basics.\nNote that you’ve used a function already: you used the function sqrt to solve the quadratic equation above. These functions do not appear in the workspace because you did not define them, but they are available for immediate use.\nIn general, we need to use parentheses to evaluate a function. If you type ls, the function is not evaluated and instead R shows you the code that defines the function. If you type ls() the function is evaluated and, as seen above, we see objects in the workspace.\nUnlike ls, most functions require one or more arguments. Below is an example of how we assign an object to the argument of the function log. Remember that we earlier defined a to be 1:\nlog(8)\r## [1] 2.079442\rlog(a)\r## [1] 0\rYou can find out what the function expects and what it does by reviewing the very useful manuals included in R. You can get help by using the help function like this:\nhelp(\u0026quot;log\u0026quot;)\rFor most functions, we can also use this shorthand:\n?log\rThe help page will show you what arguments the function is expecting. For example, log needs x and base to run. However, some arguments are required and others are optional. You can determine which arguments are optional by noting in the help document that a default value is assigned with =. Defining these is optional.5 For example, the base of the function log defaults to base = exp(1)—that is, log evaluates the natural log by default.\nIf you want a quick look at the arguments without opening the help system, you can type:\nargs(log)\r## function (x, base = exp(1)) ## NULL\rYou can change the default values by simply assigning another object:\nlog(8, base = 2)\r## [1] 3\rNote that we have not been specifying the argument x as such:\nlog(x = 8, base = 2)\r## [1] 3\rThe above code works, but we can save ourselves some typing: if no argument name is used, R assumes you are entering arguments in the order shown in the help file or by args. So by not using the names, it assumes the arguments are x followed by base:\nlog(8,2)\r## [1] 3\rIf using the arguments’ names, then we can include them in whatever order we want:\nlog(base = 2, x = 8)\r## [1] 3\rTo specify arguments, we must use =, and cannot use \u0026lt;-.\nThere are some exceptions to the rule that functions need the parentheses to be evaluated. Among these, the most commonly used are the arithmetic and relational operators. For example:\n2 ^ 3\r## [1] 8\rYou can see the arithmetic operators by typing:\nhelp(\u0026quot;+\u0026quot;)\ror\n?\u0026quot;+\u0026quot;\rand the relational operators by typing:\nhelp(\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;)\ror\n?\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\r\rOther prebuilt objects\rThere are several datasets that are included for users to practice and test out functions. You can see all the available datasets by typing:\ndata()\rThis shows you the object name for these datasets. These datasets are objects that can be used by simply typing the name. For example, if you type:\nco2\rR will show you Mauna Loa atmospheric \\(CO^2\\) concentration data.\nOther prebuilt objects are mathematical quantities, such as the constant \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\infty\\):\npi\r## [1] 3.141593\rInf+1\r## [1] Inf\r\rVariable names\rWe have used the letters a, b, and c as variable names, but variable names can be almost anything. Some basic rules in R are that variable names have to start with a letter, can’t contain spaces, and should not be variables that are predefined in R. For example, don’t name one of your variables install.packages by typing something like install.packages \u0026lt;- 2. Usually, R is smart enough to prevent you from doing such nonsense, but it’s important to develop good habits.\nA nice convention to follow is to use meaningful words that describe what is stored, use only lower case, and use underscores as a substitute for spaces. For the quadratic equations, we could use something like this:\nsolution_1 \u0026lt;- (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\rsolution_2 \u0026lt;- (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\rFor more advice, we highly recommend studying (Hadley Wickham’s style guide)[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html].\n\rSaving your workspace\rValues remain in the workspace until you end your session or erase them with the function rm. But workspaces also can be saved for later use. In fact, when you quit R, the program asks you if you want to save your workspace. If you do save it, the next time you start R, the program will restore the workspace.\nWe actually recommend against saving the workspace this way because, as you start working on different projects, it will become harder to keep track of what is saved. Instead, we recommend you assign the workspace a specific name. You can do this by using the function save or save.image. To load, use the function load. When saving a workspace, we recommend the suffix rda or RData. In RStudio, you can also do this by navigating to the Session tab and choosing Save Workspace as. You can later load it using the Load Workspace options in the same tab.\rYou can read the help pages on save, save.image, and load to learn more.\n\rMotivating scripts\rTo solve another equation such as \\(3x^2 + 2x -1\\), we can copy and paste the code above and then redefine the variables and recompute the solution:\na \u0026lt;- 3\rb \u0026lt;- 2\rc \u0026lt;- -1\r(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\r(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\rBy creating and saving a script with the code above, we would not need to retype everything each time and, instead, simply change the variable names. Try writing the script above into an editor and notice how easy it is to change the variables and receive an answer.\nThe answer you get from the 4th and 5th lines will depend on the values of a, b, and c. If you were to type new numbers directly into your console: c = 5.33 then re-run the last two lines, you will get a different answer. Your R “environment” is affected by what is run from a script and by what you type in the console. It is good (and necessary) practice to write all your code in a script (or in your Rmarkdown document), and run from the script. Always. Periodically running a script fresh from the start (clearing everything out of the environment first) is a good idea as well.\n\rCommenting your code\rIf a line of R code starts with the symbol #, it is not evaluated. We can use this to write reminders of why we wrote particular code. For example, in the script above we could add:\n## Code to compute solution to quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c\r## define the variables\ra \u0026lt;- 3\rb \u0026lt;- 2\rc \u0026lt;- -1\r## now compute the solution\r(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\r(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\rTRY IT\nWhat is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? The formula for the sum of integers \\(1\\) through \\(n\\) is \\(n(n+1)/2\\). Define \\(n=100\\) and then use R to compute the sum of \\(1\\) through \\(100\\) using the formula. What is the sum?\n\rNow use the same formula to compute the sum of the integers from 1 through 1,000.\n\rLook at the result of typing the following code into R:\n\r\rn \u0026lt;- 1000\rx \u0026lt;- seq(1, n)\rsum(x)\rBased on the result, what do you think the functions seq and sum do? You can use help.\nsum creates a list of numbers and seq adds them up.\rseq creates a list of numbers and sum adds them up.\rseq creates a random list and sum computes the sum of 1 through 1,000.\rsum always returns the same number.\r\rIn math and programming, we say that we evaluate a function when we replace the argument with a given number. So if we type sqrt(4), we evaluate the sqrt function. In R, you can evaluate a function inside another function. The evaluations happen from the inside out. Use one line of code to compute the log, in base 10, of the square root of 100.\n\rWhich of the following will always return the numeric value stored in x? You can try out examples and use the help system if you want.\n\r\rlog(10^x)\rlog10(x^10)\rlog(exp(x))\rexp(log(x, base = 2))\r\r\r## Data types\nVariables in R can be of different types. For example, we need to distinguish numbers from character strings and tables from simple lists of numbers. The function class helps us determine what type of object we have:\na \u0026lt;- 2\rclass(a)\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\rTo work efficiently in R, it is important to learn the different types of variables and what we can do with these.\n\rData frames\rUp to now, the variables we have defined are just one number. This is not very useful for storing data. The most common way of storing a dataset in R is in a data frame. Conceptually, we can think of a data frame as a table with rows representing observations and the different variables reported for each observation defining the columns. Data frames are particularly useful for datasets because we can combine different data types into one object.\nA large proportion of data analysis challenges start with data stored in a data frame. For example, we stored the data for our motivating example in a data frame. You can access this dataset by loading the dslabs library and loading the murders dataset using the data function:\nlibrary(dslabs)\r## Warning: package \u0026#39;dslabs\u0026#39; was built under R version 4.2.3\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;dslabs\u0026#39;\r## The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:gapminder\u0026#39;:\r## ## gapminder\rdata(murders)\rTo see that this is in fact a data frame, we type:\nclass(murders)\r## [1] \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\r\rExamining an object\rThe function str is useful for finding out more about the structure of an object:\nstr(murders)\r## \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;:\t51 obs. of 5 variables:\r## $ state : chr \u0026quot;Alabama\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Alaska\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Arizona\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Arkansas\u0026quot; ...\r## $ abb : chr \u0026quot;AL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AK\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AZ\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AR\u0026quot; ...\r## $ region : Factor w/ 4 levels \u0026quot;Northeast\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;South\u0026quot;,..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ...\r## $ population: num 4779736 710231 6392017 2915918 37253956 ...\r## $ total : num 135 19 232 93 1257 ...\rThis tells us much more about the object. We see that the table has 51 rows (50 states plus DC) and five variables. We can show the first six lines using the function head:\nhead(murders)\r## state abb region population total\r## 1 Alabama AL South 4779736 135\r## 2 Alaska AK West 710231 19\r## 3 Arizona AZ West 6392017 232\r## 4 Arkansas AR South 2915918 93\r## 5 California CA West 37253956 1257\r## 6 Colorado CO West 5029196 65\rIn this dataset, each state is considered an observation and five variables are reported for each state.\nBefore we go any further in answering our original question about different states, let’s learn more about the components of this object.\n\rThe accessor: $\rFor our analysis, we will need to access the different variables represented by columns included in this data frame. To do this, we use the accessor operator $ in the following way:\nmurders$population\r## [1] 4779736 710231 6392017 2915918 37253956 5029196 3574097 897934\r## [9] 601723 19687653 9920000 1360301 1567582 12830632 6483802 3046355\r## [17] 2853118 4339367 4533372 1328361 5773552 6547629 9883640 5303925\r## [25] 2967297 5988927 989415 1826341 2700551 1316470 8791894 2059179\r## [33] 19378102 9535483 672591 11536504 3751351 3831074 12702379 1052567\r## [41] 4625364 814180 6346105 25145561 2763885 625741 8001024 6724540\r## [49] 1852994 5686986 563626\rBut how did we know to use population? Previously, by applying the function str to the object murders, we revealed the names for each of the five variables stored in this table. We can quickly access the variable names using:\nnames(murders)\r## [1] \u0026quot;state\u0026quot; \u0026quot;abb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;region\u0026quot; \u0026quot;population\u0026quot; \u0026quot;total\u0026quot;\rIt is important to know that the order of the entries in murders$population preserves the order of the rows in our data table. This will later permit us to manipulate one variable based on the results of another. For example, we will be able to order the state names by the number of murders.\nTip: R comes with a very nice auto-complete functionality that saves us the trouble of typing out all the names. Try typing murders$p then hitting the tab key on your keyboard. This functionality and many other useful auto-complete features are available when working in RStudio.\n\rVectors: numerics, characters, and logical\rThe object murders$population is not one number but several. We call these types of objects vectors. A single number is technically a vector of length 1, but in general we use the term vectors to refer to objects with several entries. The function length tells you how many entries are in the vector:\npop \u0026lt;- murders$population\rlength(pop)\r## [1] 51\rThis particular vector is numeric since population sizes are numbers:\nclass(pop)\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\rIn a numeric vector, every entry must be a number.\nTo store character strings, vectors can also be of class character. For example, the state names are characters:\nclass(murders$state)\r## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;\rAs with numeric vectors, all entries in a character vector need to be a character.\nAnother important type of vectors are logical vectors. These must be either TRUE or FALSE.\nz \u0026lt;- 3 == 2\rz\r## [1] FALSE\rclass(z)\r## [1] \u0026quot;logical\u0026quot;\rHere the == is a relational operator asking if 3 is equal to 2. In R, if you just use one =, you actually assign a variable, but if you use two == you test for equality. Yet another reason to avoid assigning via =… it can get confusing and typos can really mess things up.\nYou can see the other relational operators by typing:\n?Comparison\rIn future sections, you will see how useful relational operators can be.\nWe discuss more important features of vectors after the next set of exercises.\nAdvanced: Mathematically, the values in pop are integers and there is an integer class in R. However, by default, numbers are assigned class numeric even when they are round integers. For example, class(1) returns numeric. You can turn them into class integer with the as.integer() function or by adding an L like this: 1L. Note the class by typing: class(1L)\n\rFactors\rIn the murders dataset, we might expect the region to also be a character vector. However, it is not:\nclass(murders$region)\r## [1] \u0026quot;factor\u0026quot;\rIt is a factor. Factors are useful for storing categorical data. We can see that there are only 4 regions by using the levels function:\nlevels(murders$region)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Northeast\u0026quot; \u0026quot;South\u0026quot; \u0026quot;North Central\u0026quot; \u0026quot;West\u0026quot;\rIn the background, R stores these levels as integers and keeps a map to keep track of the labels. This is more memory efficient than storing all the characters. It is also useful for computational reasons we’ll explore later.\nNote that the levels have an order that is different from the order of appearance in the factor object. The default in R is for the levels to follow alphabetical order. However, often we want the levels to follow a different order. You can specify an order through the levels argument when creating the factor with the factor function. For example, in the murders dataset regions are ordered from east to west. The function reorder lets us change the order of the levels of a factor variable based on a summary computed on a numeric vector. We will demonstrate this with a simple example, and will see more advanced ones in the Data Visualization part of the book.\nSuppose we want the levels of the region by the total number of murders rather than alphabetical order. If there are values associated with each level, we can use the reorder and specify a data summary to determine the order. The following code takes the sum of the total murders in each region, and reorders the factor following these sums.\nregion \u0026lt;- murders$region\rvalue \u0026lt;- murders$total\rregion \u0026lt;- reorder(region, value, FUN = sum)\rlevels(region)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Northeast\u0026quot; \u0026quot;North Central\u0026quot; \u0026quot;West\u0026quot; \u0026quot;South\u0026quot;\rThe new order is in agreement with the fact that the Northeast has the least murders and the South has the most.\nWarning: Factors can be a source of confusion since sometimes they behave like characters and sometimes they do not. As a result, confusing factors and characters are a common source of bugs.\n\rLists\rData frames are a special case of lists. We will cover lists in more detail later, but know that they are useful because you can store any combination of different types. Below is an example of a list we created for you:\nrecord\r## $name\r## [1] \u0026quot;John Doe\u0026quot;\r## ## $student_id\r## [1] 1234\r## ## $grades\r## [1] 95 82 91 97 93\r## ## $final_grade\r## [1] \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;\rclass(record)\r## [1] \u0026quot;list\u0026quot;\rAs with data frames, you can extract the components of a list with the accessor $. In fact, data frames are a type of list.\nrecord$student_id\r## [1] 1234\rWe can also use double square brackets ([[) like this:\nrecord[[\u0026quot;student_id\u0026quot;]]\r## [1] 1234\rYou should get used to the fact that in R there are often several ways to do the same thing. such as accessing entries.6\nYou might also encounter lists without variable names.\nrecord2\r## [[1]]\r## [1] \u0026quot;John Doe\u0026quot;\r## ## [[2]]\r## [1] 1234\rIf a list does not have names, you cannot extract the elements with $, but you can still use the brackets method and instead of providing the variable name, you provide the list index, like this:\nrecord2[[1]]\r## [1] \u0026quot;John Doe\u0026quot;\rWe won’t be using lists until later, but you might encounter one in your own exploration of R. For this reason, we show you some basics here.\n\rMatrices\rMatrices are another type of object that are common in R. Matrices are similar to data frames in that they are two-dimensional: they have rows and columns. However, like numeric, character and logical vectors, entries in matrices have to be all the same type. For this reason data frames are much more useful for storing data, since we can have characters, factors, and numbers in them.\nYet matrices have a major advantage over data frames: we can perform matrix algebra operations, a powerful type of mathematical technique. We do not describe these operations in this class, but much of what happens in the background when you perform a data analysis involves matrices. We describe them briefly here since some of the functions we will learn return matrices.\nWe can define a matrix using the matrix function. We need to specify the number of rows and columns.\nmat \u0026lt;- matrix(1:12, 4, 3)\rmat\r## [,1] [,2] [,3]\r## [1,] 1 5 9\r## [2,] 2 6 10\r## [3,] 3 7 11\r## [4,] 4 8 12\rYou can access specific entries in a matrix using square brackets ([). If you want the second row, third column, you use:\nmat[2, 3]\r## [1] 10\rIf you want the entire second row, you leave the column spot empty:\nmat[2, ]\r## [1] 2 6 10\rNotice that this returns a vector, not a matrix.\nSimilarly, if you want the entire third column, you leave the row spot empty:\nmat[, 3]\r## [1] 9 10 11 12\rThis is also a vector, not a matrix.\nYou can access more than one column or more than one row if you like. This will give you a new matrix.\nmat[, 2:3]\r## [,1] [,2]\r## [1,] 5 9\r## [2,] 6 10\r## [3,] 7 11\r## [4,] 8 12\rYou can subset both rows and columns:\nmat[1:2, 2:3]\r## [,1] [,2]\r## [1,] 5 9\r## [2,] 6 10\rWe can convert matrices into data frames using the function as.data.frame:\nas.data.frame(mat)\r## V1 V2 V3\r## 1 1 5 9\r## 2 2 6 10\r## 3 3 7 11\r## 4 4 8 12\rYou can also use single square brackets ([) to access rows and columns of a data frame:\ndata(\u0026quot;murders\u0026quot;)\rmurders[25, 1]\r## [1] \u0026quot;Mississippi\u0026quot;\rmurders[2:3, ]\r## state abb region population total\r## 2 Alaska AK West 710231 19\r## 3 Arizona AZ West 6392017 232\rTRY IT\nLoad the US murders dataset.\r\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rUse the function str to examine the structure of the murders object. Which of the following best describes the variables represented in this data frame?\nThe 51 states.\rThe murder rates for all 50 states and DC.\rThe state name, the abbreviation of the state name, the state’s region, and the state’s population and total number of murders for 2010.\rstr shows no relevant information.\r\rWhat are the column names used by the data frame for these five variables?\n\rUse the accessor $ to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object a. What is the class of this object?\n\rNow use the square brackets to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object b. Use the identical function to determine if a and b are the same.\n\rWe saw that the region column stores a factor. You can corroborate this by typing:\n\r\rclass(murders$region)\rWith one line of code, use the function levels and length to determine the number of regions defined by this dataset.\nThe function table takes a vector and returns the frequency of each element. You can quickly see how many states are in each region by applying this function. Use this function in one line of code to create a table of states per region.\r\r\r\r\rVectors\rIn R, the most basic objects available to store data are vectors. As we have seen, complex datasets can usually be broken down into components that are vectors. For example, in a data frame, each column is a vector. Here we learn more about this important class.\nCreating vectors\rWe can create vectors using the function c, which stands for concatenate. We use c to concatenate entries in the following way:\ncodes \u0026lt;- c(380, 124, 818)\rcodes\r## [1] 380 124 818\rWe can also create character vectors. We use the quotes to denote that the entries are characters rather than variable names.\ncountry \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;italy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;canada\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;egypt\u0026quot;)\rIn R you can also use single quotes:\ncountry \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;italy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;canada\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;egypt\u0026#39;)\rBut be careful not to confuse the single quote ’ with the back quote, which shares a keyboard key with ~.\nBy now you should know that if you type:\ncountry \u0026lt;- c(italy, canada, egypt)\ryou receive an error because the variables italy, canada, and egypt are not defined. If we do not use the quotes, R looks for variables with those names and returns an error.\n\rNames\rSometimes it is useful to name the entries of a vector. For example, when defining a vector of country codes, we can use the names to connect the two:\ncodes \u0026lt;- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)\rcodes\r## italy canada egypt ## 380 124 818\rThe object codes continues to be a numeric vector:\nclass(codes)\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\rbut with names:\nnames(codes)\r## [1] \u0026quot;italy\u0026quot; \u0026quot;canada\u0026quot; \u0026quot;egypt\u0026quot;\rIf the use of strings without quotes looks confusing, know that you can use the quotes as well:\ncodes \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;italy\u0026quot; = 380, \u0026quot;canada\u0026quot; = 124, \u0026quot;egypt\u0026quot; = 818)\rcodes\r## italy canada egypt ## 380 124 818\rThere is no difference between this function call and the previous one. This is one of the many ways in which R is quirky compared to other languages.\n\rSequences\rAnother useful function for creating vectors generates sequences:\nseq(1, 10)\r## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\rThe first argument defines the start, and the second defines the end which is included. The default is to go up in increments of 1, but a third argument lets us tell it how much to jump by:\nseq(1, 10, 2)\r## [1] 1 3 5 7 9\rIf we want consecutive integers, we can use the following shorthand:\n1:10\r## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\rWhen we use these functions, R produces integers, not numerics, because they are typically used to index something:\nclass(1:10)\r## [1] \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot;\rHowever, if we create a sequence including non-integers, the class changes:\nclass(seq(1, 10, 0.5))\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\r\rSubsetting\rWe use square brackets to access specific elements of a vector. For the vector codes we defined above, we can access the second element using:\ncodes[2]\r## canada ## 124\rYou can get more than one entry by using a multi-entry vector as an index:\ncodes[c(1,3)]\r## italy egypt ## 380 818\rThe sequences defined above are particularly useful if we want to access, say, the first two elements:\ncodes[1:2]\r## italy canada ## 380 124\rIf the elements have names, we can also access the entries using these names. Below are two examples.\ncodes[\u0026quot;canada\u0026quot;]\r## canada ## 124\rcodes[c(\u0026quot;egypt\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;italy\u0026quot;)]\r## egypt italy ## 818 380\r\r\rCoercion\rIn general, coercion is an attempt by R to be flexible with data types. When an entry does not match the expected, some of the prebuilt R functions try to guess what was meant before throwing an error. This can also lead to confusion. Failing to understand coercion can drive programmers crazy when attempting to code in R since it behaves quite differently from most other languages in this regard. Let’s learn about it with some examples.\nWe said that vectors must be all of the same type. So if we try to combine, say, numbers and characters, you might expect an error:\nx \u0026lt;- c(1, \u0026quot;canada\u0026quot;, 3)\rBut we don’t get one, not even a warning! What happened? Look at x and its class:\nx\r## [1] \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;canada\u0026quot; \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;\rclass(x)\r## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;\rR coerced the data into characters. It guessed that because you put a character string in the vector, you meant the 1 and 3 to actually be character strings \"1\" and “3”. The fact that not even a warning is issued is an example of how coercion can cause many unnoticed errors in R.\nR also offers functions to change from one type to another. For example, you can turn numbers into characters with:\nx \u0026lt;- 1:5\ry \u0026lt;- as.character(x)\ry\r## [1] \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5\u0026quot;\rYou can turn it back with as.numeric:\nas.numeric(y)\r## [1] 1 2 3 4 5\rThis function is actually quite useful since datasets that include numbers as character strings are common.\nNot availables (NA)\rThis “topic” seems to be wholly unappreciated and it has been our experience that students often panic when encountering an NA. This often happens when a function tries to coerce one type to another and encounters an impossible case. In such circumstances, R usually gives us a warning and turns the entry into a special value called an NA (for “not available”). For example:\nx \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;)\ras.numeric(x)\r## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion\r## [1] 1 NA 3\rR does not have any guesses for what number you want when you type b, so it does not try.\nWhile coercion is a common case leading to NAs, you’ll see them in nearly every real-world dataset. Most often, you will encounter the NAs as a stand-in for missing data. Again, this a common problem in real-world datasets and you need to be aware that it will come up.\n\r\rSorting\rNow that we have mastered some basic R knowledge (ha!), let’s try to gain some insights into the safety of different states in the context of gun murders.\nsort\rSay we want to rank the states from least to most gun murders. The function sort sorts a vector in increasing order. We can therefore see the largest number of gun murders by typing:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rsort(murders$total)\r## [1] 2 4 5 5 7 8 11 12 12 16 19 21 22 27 32\r## [16] 36 38 53 63 65 67 84 93 93 97 97 99 111 116 118\r## [31] 120 135 142 207 219 232 246 250 286 293 310 321 351 364 376\r## [46] 413 457 517 669 805 1257\rHowever, this does not give us information about which states have which murder totals. For example, we don’t know which state had 1257.\n\rorder\rThe function order is closer to what we want. It takes a vector as input and returns the vector of indexes that sorts the input vector. This may sound confusing so let’s look at a simple example. We can create a vector and sort it:\nx \u0026lt;- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)\rsort(x)\r## [1] 4 15 31 65 92\rRather than sort the input vector, the function order returns the index that sorts input vector:\nindex \u0026lt;- order(x)\rx[index]\r## [1] 4 15 31 65 92\rThis is the same output as that returned by sort(x). If we look at this index, we see why it works:\nx\r## [1] 31 4 15 92 65\rorder(x)\r## [1] 2 3 1 5 4\rThe second entry of x is the smallest, so order(x) starts with 2. The next smallest is the third entry, so the second entry is 3 and so on.\nHow does this help us order the states by murders? First, remember that the entries of vectors you access with $ follow the same order as the rows in the table. For example, these two vectors containing state names and abbreviations, respectively, are matched by their order:\nmurders$state[1:6]\r## [1] \u0026quot;Alabama\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Alaska\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Arizona\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Arkansas\u0026quot; \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;\r## [6] \u0026quot;Colorado\u0026quot;\rmurders$abb[1:6]\r## [1] \u0026quot;AL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AK\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AZ\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AR\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CO\u0026quot;\rThis means we can order the state names by their total murders. We first obtain the index that orders the vectors according to murder totals and then index the state names vector:\nind \u0026lt;- order(murders$total)\rmurders$abb[ind]\r## [1] \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ND\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NH\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WY\u0026quot; \u0026quot;HI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;SD\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ME\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;RI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AK\u0026quot; \u0026quot;IA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;UT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WV\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NE\u0026quot;\r## [16] \u0026quot;OR\u0026quot; \u0026quot;DE\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MN\u0026quot; \u0026quot;KS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CO\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NM\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NV\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AR\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;DC\u0026quot; \u0026quot;OK\u0026quot; \u0026quot;KY\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MA\u0026quot;\r## [31] \u0026quot;MS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;IN\u0026quot; \u0026quot;SC\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TN\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AZ\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NJ\u0026quot; \u0026quot;VA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NC\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MD\u0026quot; \u0026quot;OH\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MO\u0026quot; \u0026quot;LA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;IL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;GA\u0026quot;\r## [46] \u0026quot;MI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;PA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NY\u0026quot; \u0026quot;FL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TX\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CA\u0026quot;\rAccording to the above, California had the most murders.\n\rmax and which.max\rIf we are only interested in the entry with the largest value, we can use max for the value:\nmax(murders$total)\r## [1] 1257\rand which.max for the index of the largest value:\ni_max \u0026lt;- which.max(murders$total)\rmurders$state[i_max]\r## [1] \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;\rFor the minimum, we can use min and which.min in the same way.\nDoes this mean California is the most dangerous state? In an upcoming section, we argue that we should be considering rates instead of totals. Before doing that, we introduce one last order-related function: rank.\n\rrank\rAlthough not as frequently used as order and sort, the function rank is also related to order and can be useful.\rFor any given vector it returns a vector with the rank of the first entry, second entry, etc., of the input vector. Here is a simple example:\nx \u0026lt;- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)\rrank(x)\r## [1] 3 1 2 5 4\rTo summarize, let’s look at the results of the three functions we have introduced:\n\r\roriginal\r\rsort\r\rorder\r\rrank\r\r\r\r\r\r31\r\r4\r\r2\r\r3\r\r\r\r4\r\r15\r\r3\r\r1\r\r\r\r15\r\r31\r\r1\r\r2\r\r\r\r92\r\r65\r\r5\r\r5\r\r\r\r65\r\r92\r\r4\r\r4\r\r\r\r\r\rBeware of recycling\rAnother common source of unnoticed errors in R is the use of recycling. We saw that vectors are added elementwise. So if the vectors don’t match in length, it is natural to assume that we should get an error. But we don’t. Notice what happens:\nx \u0026lt;- c(1,2,3)\ry \u0026lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)\rx+y\r## Warning in x + y: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object\r## length\r## [1] 11 22 33 41 52 63 71\rWe do get a warning, but no error. For the output, R has recycled the numbers in x. Notice the last digit of numbers in the output.\nTRY IT\nFor these exercises we will use the US murders dataset. Make sure you load it prior to starting.\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(\u0026quot;murders\u0026quot;)\rUse the $ operator to access the population size data and store it as the object pop. Then use the sort function to redefine pop so that it is sorted. Finally, use the [ operator to report the smallest population size.\n\rNow instead of the smallest population size, find the index of the entry with the smallest population size. Hint: use order instead of sort.\n\rWe can actually perform the same operation as in the previous exercise using the function which.min. Write one line of code that does this.\n\rNow we know how small the smallest state is and we know which row represents it. Which state is it? Define a variable states to be the state names from the murders data frame. Report the name of the state with the smallest population.\n\rYou can create a data frame using the data.frame function. Here is a quick example:\n\r\rtemp \u0026lt;- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)\rcity \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Beijing\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Lagos\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Paris\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Rio de Janeiro\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;San Juan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Toronto\u0026quot;)\rcity_temps \u0026lt;- data.frame(name = city, temperature = temp)\rUse the rank function to determine the population rank of each state from smallest population size to biggest. Save these ranks in an object called ranks, then create a data frame with the state name and its rank. Call the data frame my_df.\nRepeat the previous exercise, but this time order my_df so that the states are ordered from least populous to most populous. Hint: create an object ind that stores the indexes needed to order the population values. Then use the bracket operator [ to re-order each column in the data frame.\n\rThe na_example vector represents a series of counts. You can quickly examine the object using:\n\r\rdata(\u0026quot;na_example\u0026quot;)\rstr(na_example)\r## int [1:1000] 2 1 3 2 1 3 1 4 3 2 ...\rHowever, when we compute the average with the function mean, we obtain an NA:\nmean(na_example)\r## [1] NA\rThe is.na function returns a logical vector that tells us which entries are NA. Assign this logical vector to an object called ind and determine how many NAs does na_example have.\nNow compute the average again, but only for the entries that are not NA. Hint: remember the ! operator.\r\r\r\r\rVector arithmetics\rCalifornia had the most murders, but does this mean it is the most dangerous state? What if it just has many more people than any other state? We can quickly confirm that California indeed has the largest population:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(\u0026quot;murders\u0026quot;)\rmurders$state[which.max(murders$population)]\r## [1] \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;\rwith over 37 million inhabitants. It is therefore unfair to compare the totals if we are interested in learning how safe the state is. What we really should be computing is the murders per capita. The reports we describe in the motivating section used murders per 100,000 as the unit. To compute this quantity, the powerful vector arithmetic capabilities of R come in handy.\nRescaling a vector\rIn R, arithmetic operations on vectors occur element-wise. For a quick example, suppose we have height in inches:\ninches \u0026lt;- c(69, 62, 66, 70, 70, 73, 67, 73, 67, 70)\rand want to convert to centimeters. Notice what happens when we multiply inches by 2.54:\ninches * 2.54\r## [1] 175.26 157.48 167.64 177.80 177.80 185.42 170.18 185.42 170.18 177.80\rIn the line above, we multiplied each element by 2.54. Similarly, if for each entry we want to compute how many inches taller or shorter than 69 inches, the average height for males, we can subtract it from every entry like this:\ninches - 69\r## [1] 0 -7 -3 1 1 4 -2 4 -2 1\r\rTwo vectors\rIf we have two vectors of the same length, and we sum them in R, they will be added entry by entry as follows:\n\\[\r\\begin{pmatrix}\ra\\\\\rb\\\\\rc\\\\\rd\r\\end{pmatrix}\r+\r\\begin{pmatrix}\re\\\\\rf\\\\\rg\\\\\rh\r\\end{pmatrix}\r=\r\\begin{pmatrix}\ra +e\\\\\rb + f\\\\\rc + g\\\\\rd + h\r\\end{pmatrix}\r\\]\nThe same holds for other mathematical operations, such as -, * and /.\nThis implies that to compute the murder rates we can simply type:\nmurder_rate \u0026lt;- murders$total / murders$population * 100000\rOnce we do this, we notice that California is no longer near the top of the list. In fact, we can use what we have learned to order the states by murder rate:\nmurders$abb[order(murder_rate)]\r## [1] \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NH\u0026quot; \u0026quot;HI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ND\u0026quot; \u0026quot;IA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot; \u0026quot;UT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ME\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WY\u0026quot; \u0026quot;OR\u0026quot; \u0026quot;SD\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MN\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CO\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WA\u0026quot;\r## [16] \u0026quot;WV\u0026quot; \u0026quot;RI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;WI\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NE\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;IN\u0026quot; \u0026quot;KS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NY\u0026quot; \u0026quot;KY\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AK\u0026quot; \u0026quot;OH\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CT\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NJ\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;IL\u0026quot;\r## [31] \u0026quot;OK\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NC\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NV\u0026quot; \u0026quot;VA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AR\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TX\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NM\u0026quot; \u0026quot;CA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;FL\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TN\u0026quot; \u0026quot;PA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AZ\u0026quot; \u0026quot;GA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MI\u0026quot;\r## [46] \u0026quot;DE\u0026quot; \u0026quot;SC\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MD\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MO\u0026quot; \u0026quot;LA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;DC\u0026quot;\rTRY IT\nPreviously we created this data frame:\r\rtemp \u0026lt;- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)\rcity \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Beijing\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Lagos\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Paris\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Rio de Janeiro\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;San Juan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Toronto\u0026quot;)\rcity_temps \u0026lt;- data.frame(name = city, temperature = temp)\rRemake the data frame using the code above, but add a line that converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The conversion is \\(C = \\frac{5}{9} \\times (F - 32)\\).\nWrite code to compute the following sum \\(1+1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + \\dots 1/100^2\\)? Hint: thanks to Euler, we know it should be close to \\(\\pi^2/6\\).\n\rCompute the per 100,000 murder rate for each state and store it in the object murder_rate. Then compute the average murder rate for the US using the function mean. What is the average?\n\r\r\r\r\rIndexing\rIndexing is a boring name for an important tool. R provides a powerful and convenient way of referencing specific elements of vectors. We can, for example, subset a vector based on properties of another vector. In this section, we continue working with our US murders example, which we can load like this:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(\u0026quot;murders\u0026quot;)\rSubsetting with logicals\rWe have now calculated the murder rate using:\nmurder_rate \u0026lt;- murders$total / murders$population * 100000\rImagine you are moving from Italy where, according to an ABC news report, the murder rate is only 0.71 per 100,000. You would prefer to move to a state with a similar murder rate. Another powerful feature of R is that we can use logicals to index vectors. If we compare a vector to a single number, it actually performs the test for each entry. The following is an example related to the question above:\nind \u0026lt;- murder_rate \u0026lt; 0.71\rIf we instead want to know if a value is less or equal, we can use:\nind \u0026lt;- murder_rate \u0026lt;= 0.71\rNote that we get back a logical vector with TRUE for each entry smaller than or equal to 0.71. To see which states these are, we can leverage the fact that vectors can be indexed with logicals.\nmurders$state[ind]\r## [1] \u0026quot;Hawaii\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Iowa\u0026quot; \u0026quot;New Hampshire\u0026quot; \u0026quot;North Dakota\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;Vermont\u0026quot;\rIn order to count how many are TRUE, the function sum returns the sum of the entries of a vector and logical vectors get coerced to numeric with TRUE coded as 1 and FALSE as 0. Thus we can count the states using:\nsum(ind)\r## [1] 5\r\rLogical operators\rSuppose we like the mountains and we want to move to a safe state in the western region of the country. We want the murder rate to be at most 1. In this case, we want two different things to be true. Here we can use the logical operator and, which in R is represented with \u0026amp;. This operation results in TRUE only when both logicals are TRUE. To see this, consider this example:\nTRUE \u0026amp; TRUE\r## [1] TRUE\rTRUE \u0026amp; FALSE\r## [1] FALSE\rFALSE \u0026amp; FALSE\r## [1] FALSE\rFor our example, we can form two logicals:\nwest \u0026lt;- murders$region == \u0026quot;West\u0026quot;\rsafe \u0026lt;- murder_rate \u0026lt;= 1\rand we can use the \u0026amp; to get a vector of logicals that tells us which states satisfy both conditions:\nind \u0026lt;- safe \u0026amp; west\rmurders$state[ind]\r## [1] \u0026quot;Hawaii\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Idaho\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Oregon\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Utah\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Wyoming\u0026quot;\r\rwhich\rSuppose we want to look up California’s murder rate. For this type of operation, it is convenient to convert vectors of logicals into indexes instead of keeping long vectors of logicals. The function which tells us which entries of a logical vector are TRUE. So we can type:\nind \u0026lt;- which(murders$state == \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;)\rmurder_rate[ind]\r## [1] 3.374138\r\r%in%\rIf rather than an index we want a logical that tells us whether or not each element of a first vector is in a second, we can use the function %in%. Let’s imagine you are not sure if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states. You can find out like this:\nc(\u0026quot;Boston\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Dakota\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Washington\u0026quot;) %in% murders$state\r## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE\rNote that we will be using %in% often throughout the course\nTRY IT\nStart by loading the library and data.\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rCompute the per 100,000 murder rate for each state and store it in an object called murder_rate. Then use logical operators to create a logical vector named low that tells us which entries of murder_rate are lower than 1.\n\rNow use the results from the previous exercise and the function which to determine the indices of murder_rate associated with values lower than 1.\n\rUse the results from the previous exercise to report the names of the states with murder rates lower than 1.\n\rNow extend the code from exercises 2 and 3 to report the states in the Northeast with murder rates lower than 1. Hint: use the previously defined logical vector low and the logical operator \u0026amp;.\n\rIn a previous exercise we computed the murder rate for each state and the average of these numbers. How many states are below the average?\n\rUse the match function to identify the states with abbreviations AK, MI, and IA. Hint: start by defining an index of the entries of murders$abb that match the three abbreviations, then use the [ operator to extract the states.\n\rUse the %in% operator to create a logical vector that answers the question: which of the following are actual abbreviations: MA, ME, MI, MO, MU?\n\rExtend the code you used in exercise 7 to report the one entry that is not an actual abbreviation. Hint: use the ! operator, which turns FALSE into TRUE and vice versa, then which to obtain an index.\n\r\r\r\r\rFurther help with R\rIf you are not comfortable with R, the earlier you seek out help, the better.

RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\rThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\r\rIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\r\rDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\rInstall tidyverse\rR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including the ever-present ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel. Hopefully you’ve experienced installing packages before now; if not, consider this a crash course!\n\rInstall tinytex\rWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX.2\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB. To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere’s how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\rRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\rWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\rThe end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.\r\rFind the course assignment template (for SSC442, see the Assignments page), right-click to download it (don’t just click on it - that won’t work), open it in Rstudio, and without changing anything, click the “knit” button to test out your install. Your system should open a PDF that looks like something like this:\nSee the Markdown and R Markdown sidebars for instructions on using the template.\n\r\rIt’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n\rPronounced “lay-tek” for those who are correct; or “lah-tex” to those who love goofy nerdy pronunciation.

To convince yourself, print and stare at the US murders data table:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rhead(murders)\r## state abb region population total\r## 1 Alabama AL South 4779736 135\r## 2 Alaska AK West 710231 19\r## 3 Arizona AZ West 6392017 232\r## 4 Arkansas AR South 2915918 93\r## 5 California CA West 37253956 1257\r## 6 Colorado CO West 5029196 65\rWhat do you learn from staring at this table? Even though it is a relatively straightforward table, we can’t learn anything. For starters, it is grossly abbreviated, though you could scroll through. In doing so, how quickly might you be able to determine which states have the largest populations? Which states have the smallest? How populous is a typical state? Is there a relationship between population size and total murders? How do murder rates vary across regions of the country? For most folks, it is quite difficult to extract this information just by looking at the numbers. In contrast, the answer to the questions above are readily available from examining this plot:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(ggthemes)\rlibrary(ggrepel)\rr \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(pop=sum(population), tot=sum(total)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) %\u0026gt;% pull(rate)\rmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +\rgeom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col=\u0026quot;darkgrey\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +\rgeom_text_repel() +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10() +\rxlab(\u0026quot;Populations in millions (log scale)\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Total number of murders (log scale)\u0026quot;) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;US Gun Murders in 2010\u0026quot;) +\rscale_color_discrete(name=\u0026quot;Region\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_economist_white()\rWe are reminded of the saying: “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Data visualization provides a powerful way to communicate a data-driven finding. In some cases, the visualization is so convincing that no follow-up analysis is required. You should consider visualization the most potent tool in your data analytics arsenal.\nThe growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many industries, academia, and government. A salient example is news organizations, which are increasingly embracing data journalism and including effective infographics as part of their reporting.\nA particularly salient example—given the current state of the world—is a Wall Street Journal article1 showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases. One of the graphs shows measles cases by US state through the years with a vertical line demonstrating when the vaccine was introduced.\n## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\r## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\r## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.\r## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was\r## generated.\r(Source: Wall Street Journal)\nAnother striking example comes from a New York Times chart2, which summarizes scores from the NYC Regents Exams. As described in\rthe article3, these scores are collected for several reasons, including to determine if a student graduates from high school. In New York City you need a 65 to pass. The distribution of the test scores forces us to notice something somewhat problematic:\n(Source: New York Times via Amanda Cox)\nThe most common test score is the minimum passing grade, with very few scores just below the threshold. This unexpected result is consistent with students close to passing having their scores bumped up.\nThis is an example of how data visualization can lead to discoveries which would otherwise be missed if we simply subjected the data to a battery of data analysis tools or procedures. Data visualization is the strongest tool of what we call exploratory data analysis (EDA). John W. Tukey4, considered the father of EDA, once said,\n\r\r“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”\n\r\rMany widely used data analysis tools were initiated by discoveries made via EDA. EDA is perhaps the most important part of data analysis, yet it is one that is often overlooked.\nData visualization is also now pervasive in philanthropic and educational organizations. In the talks New Insights on Poverty5 and The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen6, Hans Rosling forces us to notice the unexpected with a series of plots related to world health and economics. In his videos, he uses animated graphs to show us how the world is changing and how old narratives are no longer true.\nIt is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. Failure to discover these problems can give rise to flawed analyses and false discoveries. As an example, consider that measurement devices sometimes fail and that most data analysis procedures are not designed to detect these. Yet these data analysis procedures will still give you an answer. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice an error just from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important.\nToday, we will discuss the basics of data visualization and exploratory data analysis. We will use the ggplot2 package to code. To learn the very basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example: heights reported by students. Then we will cover the two examples mentioned above: 1) world health and economics and 2) infectious disease trends in the United States.\nOf course, there is much more to data visualization than what we cover here.

One can quickly go from idea to data to plot with a unique balance of flexibility and ease. For example, Excel may be easier than R for some plots, but it is nowhere near as flexible. D3.js may be more flexible and powerful than R, but it takes much longer to generate a plot. One of the reasons we use R is its incredible flexibility and ease.\nThroughout this course, we will be creating plots using the ggplot27 package.\nlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rMany other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as grid and lattice. We chose to use ggplot2 in this course because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember.\nOne reason ggplot2 is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a so-called “grammar of graphics”8, the letters gg in ggplot2. This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of ggplot2 building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots.\nAnother reason ggplot2 is easy for beginners is that its default behavior is carefully chosen to satisfy the great majority of cases and is visually pleasing. As a result, it is possible to create informative and elegant graphs with relatively simple and readable code.\nOne limitation is that ggplot2 is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format (where rows are observations and columns are variables). However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are in, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data is tidy, ggplot2 simplifies plotting code and the learning of grammar for a variety of plots. You should review the previous content about tidy data if you are feeling lost.\nTo use ggplot2 you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize, so we highly recommend you have the ggplot2 cheat sheet handy. You can get a copy here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf or simply perform an internet search for “ggplot2 cheat sheet”.\nThe components of a graph\rWe will eventually construct a graph that summarizes the US murders dataset that looks like this:\nWe can clearly see how much states vary across population size and the total number of murders. Not surprisingly, we also see a clear relationship between murder totals and population size. A state falling on the dashed grey line has the same murder rate as the US average. The four geographic regions are denoted with color, which depicts how most southern states have murder rates above the average.\nThis data visualization shows us pretty much all the information in the data table. The code needed to make this plot is relatively simple. We will learn to create the plot part by part.\nThe first step in learning ggplot2 is to be able to break a graph apart into components. Let’s break down the plot above and introduce some of the ggplot2 terminology. The main five components to note are:\n\rData: The US murders data table is being summarized. We refer to this as the data component.\n\rGeometry: The plot above is a scatterplot. This is referred to as the\rgeometry component. Other possible geometries are barplot, histogram, smooth densities, qqplot, boxplot, pie (ew!), and many, many more. We will learn about these later.\n\rAesthetic mapping: The plot uses several visual cues to represent the information provided by the dataset. The two most important cues in this plot are the point positions on the x-axis and y-axis, which represent population size and the total number of murders, respectively. Each point represents a different observation, and we map data about these observations to visual cues like x- and y-scale. Color is another visual cue that we map to region. We refer to this as the aesthetic mapping component. How we define the mapping depends on what geometry we are using.\n\rAnnotations: These are things like axis labels, axis ticks (the lines along the axis at regular intervals or specific points of interest), axis scales (e.g. log-scale), titles, legends, etc.\n\rStyle: An overall appearance of the graph determined by fonts, color palattes, layout, blank spaces, and more.\n\r\rWe also note that:\n\rThe points are labeled with the state abbreviations.\rThe range of the x-axis and y-axis appears to be defined by the range of the data. They are both on log-scales.\rThere are labels, a title, a legend, and we use the style of The Economist magazine.\r\rAll of the flexibility and visualization power of ggplot is contained in these four elements (plus your data)\n\rggplot objects\rWe will now construct the plot piece by piece.\nWe start by loading the dataset:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rThe first step in creating a ggplot2 graph is to define a ggplot object. We do this with the function ggplot, which initializes the graph. If we read the help file for this function, we see that the first argument is used to specify what data is associated with this object:\nggplot(data = murders)\rWe can also pipe the data in as the first argument. So this line of code is equivalent to the one above:\nmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot()\rIt renders a plot, in this case a blank slate since no geometry has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background.\nWhat has happened above is that the object was created and, because it was not assigned, it was automatically evaluated. But we can assign our plot to an object, for example like this:\np \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = murders)\rclass(p)\r## [1] \u0026quot;gg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ggplot\u0026quot;\rTo render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object p. The following two lines of code each produce the same plot we see above:\nprint(p)\rp\r\rGeometries (briefly)\rIn ggplot2 we create graphs by adding geometry layers. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, create annotations, or even change styles. To add layers, we use the symbol +. In general, a line of code will look like this:\n\rDATA %\u0026gt;% ggplot() + LAYER 1 + LAYER 2 + ... + LAYER N\n\rUsually, the first added layer after ggplot() + defines the geometry. After that, we may add additional geometries, we may rescale an axis, we may add annotations and labels, or we may change the style. For now, we want to make a scatterplot like the one you all created in Lab 0. What geometry do we use?\nTaking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that the ggplot2 function used to create plots with this geometry is geom_point.\n(Image courtesy of RStudio9. CC-BY-4.0 license10.)\nGeometry function names follow the pattern: geom_X where X is the name of some specific geometry. Some examples include geom_point, geom_bar, and geom_histogram. You’ve already seen a few of these. We will start with a scatterplot created using geom_point() for now, then circle back to more geometries after we cover aesthetic mappings, layers, and annotations.\nFor geom_point to run properly we need to provide data and an aesthetic mapping. The simplest mapping for a scatter plot is to say we want one variable on the X-axis, and a different one on the Y-axis, so each point is an {X,Y} pair. That is an aesthetic mapping because X and Y are aesthetics in a geom_point scatterplot.\nWe have already connected the object p with the murders data table, and if we add the layer geom_point it defaults to using this data. To find out what mappings are expected, we read the Aesthetics section of the help file ?geom_point help file:\n\u0026gt; Aesthetics\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; geom_point understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; **x**\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; **y**\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; alpha\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; colour\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; fill\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; group\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; shape\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; size\r\u0026gt;\r\u0026gt; stroke\rand—although it does not show in bold above—we see that at least two arguments are required: x and y. You can’t have a geom_point scatterplot unless you state what you want on the X and Y axes.\n\rAesthetic mappings\rAesthetic mappings describe how properties of the data connect with features of the graph, such as distance along an axis, size, or color. The aes function connects data with what we see on the graph by defining aesthetic mappings and will be one of the functions you use most often when plotting. The outcome of the aes function is often used as the argument of a geometry function. This example produces a scatterplot of population in millions (x-axis) versus total murders (y-axis):\nmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot() +\rgeom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))\rInstead of defining our plot from scratch, we can also add a layer to the p object that was defined above as p \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = murders):\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))\rThe scales and annotations like axis labels are defined by default when adding this layer (note the x-axis label is exactly what we wrote in the function call). Like dplyr functions, aes also uses the variable names from the object component: we can use population and total without having to call them as murders$population and murders$total. The behavior of recognizing the variables from the data component is quite specific to aes. With most functions, if you try to access the values of population or total outside of aes you receive an error.\nNote that we did some rescaling within the aes() call - we can do simple things like multiplication or division on the variable names in the ggplot call. The axis labels reflect this. We will change the axis labels later.\nThe aesthetic mappings are very powerful - changing the variable in x= or y= changes the meaning of the plot entirely. We’ll come back to additional aesthetic mappings once we talk about aesthetics in general.\nAesthetics in general\rEven without mappings, a plots aesthetics can be useful. Things like color, fill, alpha, and size are aesthetics that can be changed.\nLet’s say we want larger points in our scatterplot. The size aesthetic can be used to set the size. The scale of size is “multiples of the defaults” (so size = 1 is the default)\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 3)\rsize is not a mapping so it is not in the aes() part: whereas mappings use data from specific observations and need to be inside aes(), operations we want to affect all the points the same way do not need to be included inside aes. We’ll see what happens if size is inside aes(size = xxx) in a second.\nWe can change the shape to one of the many different base-R options found here:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 3, shape = 17)\rWe can also change the fill and the color:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 4, shape = 23, fill = \u0026#39;#18453B\u0026#39;)\rfill can take a common name like 'green', or can take a hex color like '#18453B', which is MSU Green according to MSU’s branding site. You can also find UM Maize and OSU Scarlet on respective branding pages, or google “XXX color hex.” We’ll learn how to build a color palatte later on.\ncolor (or colour, same thing because ggplot creators allow both spellings) is a little tricky with points - it changes the outline of the geometry rather than the fill color, but in geom_point() most shapes are only the outline, including the default. This is more useful with, say, a barplot where the outline and the fill might be different colors. Still, shapes 21-25 have both fill and color:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 5, shape = 23, fill = \u0026#39;#18453B\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;white\u0026#39;)\rThe color = 'white' makes the outline of the shape white, which you can see if you look closely in the areas where the shapes overlap. This only works with shapes 21-25, or any other geometry that has both an outline and a fill.\n\rNow, back to aesthetic mappings\rNow that we’ve seen a few aesthetics (and know we can find more by looking at which aesthetics work with our geometry in the help file), let’s return to the power of aesthetic mappings.\nAn aesthetic mapping means we can vary an aesthetic (like fill or shape or size) according to some variable in our data. This opens up a world of possibilities! Let’s try adding to our x and y aesthetics with a color aesthetic (since points respond to color better than fill) that varies by region, which is a column in our data:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, color = region), size = 3)\rWe include color=region inside the aes call, which tells R to find a variable called region and change color based on that. R will choose a somewhat ghastly color palatte, and every unique value in the data for region will get a different color if the variable is discrete. If the variable is a continuous value, then ggplot will automatically make a color ramp. Thus, discrete and continuous values for aesthetic mappings work differently.\nLet’s see a useful example of a continuous aesthetic mapping to color. In our data, we are making a scatterplot of population and total murders, which really just shows that states with higher populations have higher murders. What we really want is murders per capita (I think COVID taught us a lot about rates vs. levels like “cases” and “cases per 100,000 people”). We can create a variable of “murders per capita” on the fly. Since “murders per capita” is a very small number and hard to read, we’ll multiply by 100 so that we get “percent of population murdered per year”:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^5, y = total, color = 100*total/population), size = 3)\rWhile the clear pattern of “more population means more murders” is still there, look at the outlier in light blue in the bottom left. With the color ramp, see how easy it is to see here that there is one location where murders per capita is quite high?\nNote that size is outside of aes and is set to an explicit value, not to a variable. What if we set size to a variable in the data?\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, color = region, size = population/10^6))\r\rLegends for aesthetics\rHere we see yet another useful default behavior: ggplot2 automatically adds a legend that maps color to region, and size to population (which we scaled by 1,000,000). To avoid adding this legend we set the geom_point argument show.legend = FALSE. This removes both the size and the color legend.\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, color = region, size = population/10^6), show.legend = FALSE)\rLater on, when we get to annotation layers, we’ll talk about controlling the legend text and layout. For now, we just need to know how to turn them off.\n\r\rAnnotation Layers\rA second layer in the plot we wish to make involves adding a label to each point to identify the state. The geom_label and geom_text functions permit us to add text to the plot with and without a rectangle behind the text, respectively.\nBecause each point (each state in this case) has a label, we need an aesthetic mapping to make the connection between points and labels. By reading the help file ?geom_text, we learn that we supply the mapping between point and label through the label argument of aes. That is, label is an aesthetic that we can map. So the code looks like this:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) +\rgeom_text(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb))\rWe have successfully added a second layer to the plot.\nAs an example of the unique behavior of aes mentioned above, note that this call:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))\ris fine, whereas this call:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = abb)\rwill give you an error since abb is not found because it is outside of the aes function. The layer geom_text does not know where to find abb since it is a column name and not a global variable, and ggplot does not look for column names for non-mapped aesthetics. For a trivial example:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) +\rgeom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = \u0026#39;abb\u0026#39;)\rGlobal versus local aesthetic mappings\rIn the previous line of code, we define the mapping aes(population/10^6, total) twice, once in each geometry. We can avoid this by using a global aesthetic mapping. We can do this when we define the blank slate ggplot object. Remember that the function ggplot contains an argument that permits us to define aesthetic mappings:\nargs(ggplot)\r## function (data = NULL, mapping = aes(), ..., environment = parent.frame()) ## NULL\rIf we define a mapping in ggplot, all the geometries that are added as layers will default to this mapping. We redefine p:\np \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb))\rand then we can simply write the following code to produce the previous plot:\np + geom_point(size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 1.5) # offsets the label\rWe keep the size and nudge_x arguments in geom_point and geom_text, respectively, because we want to only increase the size of points and only nudge the labels. If we put those arguments in aes then they would apply to both plots. Also note that the geom_point function does not need a label argument and therefore ignores that aesthetic.\nIf necessary, we can override the global mapping by defining a new mapping within each layer. These local definitions override the global. Here is an example:\np + geom_point(size = 3) +\rgeom_text(aes(x = 10, y = 800, label = \u0026quot;Hello there!\u0026quot;))\rClearly, the second call to geom_text does not use x = population and y = total.\n\r\rTry it!\rLet’s break in to smaller groups and try playing with some of the aesthetics and aesthetic mappings. If we’re in person (woohoo!), we’ll form the same number of groups in class.\nIn each group, one person should be the main coder - someone who has the packages like dslabs installed and has successfully run the plots above. Each set of tasks ask you to learn about an aesthetic and put it into action with the murder data. We’ll leave about 5 minutes to do the task, then have you come back and share your results with the class.\nFor each group, we’ll start with the following code:\np + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) +\rgeom_text(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb))\rThe alpha aesthetic mapping.\rThe alpha aesthetic can only take a number between 0 and 1. So first, in murders, create a murders_per_capita column by dividing total by population. Second, find the max(murders$murders_per_capita) and then create another new column called murders_per_capita_rescaled which divides murders_per_capita by the max value. murders_per_capita_rescaled will be between 0 and 1, with the value of 1 for the state with the max murder rate. This is a little hard to do on the fly in ggplot.\rSet the alpha aesthetic mapping to murders_per_capita_rescaled for geom_point.\rTurn off the legend using show.legend=FALSE\rInclude the geom_text labels, but make sure the aesthetic mapping does not apply to the labels.\rUse nudge_x = 1.5 as before to offset the labels.\rBe able to explain the plot.\r\rDoes the alpha aesthetic help present the data here? It’s OK if it doesn’t!\r\r\rThe stroke aesthetic mapping.\rThe stroke aesthetic works a bit like the size aesthetic. It must be used with a plot that has both a border and a fill, like shapes 21-25, so use one of those.\rUse the stroke aesthetic mapping (meaning the stroke will change according to a value in the data) to set a different stroke size based on murders per capita. You can create a murders per capita variable on the fly, or add it to your murders data.\r\rInclude the text labels as before and use nudge_x = 1.5.\rMake sure you’re only setting the aesthetic for the points on the scatterplot!\r\r\rThe angle aesthetic\rUsing the ?geom_text help, note that geom_text takes an aesthetic of angle.\rUse the angle aesthetic (not aesthetic mapping) in the appropriate place (e.g. on geom_text and not on other geometries) to adjust the labels on our plot.\rNow, try using the angle aesthetic mapping by using the total field as both the y value and the angle value in the geom_text layer.\rDoes using angle as an aesthetic help? What about as an aesthetic mapping?\r\rThe color aesthetic mapping\rSet the color aesthetic mapping in geom_text to total/population.\r\rUse the nudge_x = 1.5 aesthetic in geom_text still\r\rTry it with and without the legend using show.legend.\rBe able to explain the plot.\r\rDoes the color aesthetic mapping help present the data here?\r\r\rgeom_label and the fill aesthetic\rLooking at ?geom_label (which is the same help as geom_text), we note that “The fill aesthetic controls the backgreound colour of the label”.\rSet the fill aesthetic mapping to total/population in geom_label (replacing geom_text but still using nudge_x=1.5)\rSet the fill aesthetic (not mapping) to the color of your choice.\rBe able to explain the plots.\r\r\rDoes the fill aesthetic mapping help present the data here?\rWhat color did you choose for the non-mapped fill aesthetic?\r\r\r\rFor Fall 2022 in-person, we can use our office hours Zoom to share screen: https://msu.zoom.us/j/91759862734?pwd=VDliRHdoQ3N4L3V4LzNFd3IzcGw2dz09.

For example, the quality of a high school is sometimes summarized with one number: the average score on a standardized test. Occasionally, a second number is reported: the standard deviation. For example, you might read a report stating that scores were 680 plus or minus 50 (the standard deviation). The report has summarized an entire vector of scores with just two numbers. Is this appropriate? Is there any important piece of information that we are missing by only looking at this summary rather than the entire list?\nOur first data visualization building block is learning to summarize lists of factors or numeric vectors—the two primary data types that we encounter in data analytics. More often than not, the best way to share or explore this summary is through data visualization. The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. Once a vector has been summarized as a distribution, there are several data visualization techniques to effectively relay this information.\nIn this section, we first discuss properties of a variety of distributions and how to visualize distributions using a motivating example of student heights. We then discuss some principles of data visualizations more broadly, and introduce new ggplot geometries to help us along the way.\nVariable types\rWe will be working with two types of variables: categorical and numeric. Each can be divided into two other groups: categorical can be ordinal or not, whereas numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.\nWhen each entry in a vector comes from one of a small number of groups, we refer to the data as categorical data. Two simple examples are sex (male or female) and regions (Northeast, South, North Central, West). Some categorical data can be ordered even if they are not numbers per se, such as spiciness (mild, medium, hot). In statistics textbooks, ordered categorical data are referred to as ordinal data. In psychology, a number of different terms are used for this same idea.\nExamples of numerical data are population sizes, murder rates, and heights. Some numerical data can be treated as ordered categorical. We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete. Continuous variables are those that can take any value, such as heights, if measured with enough precision. For example, a pair of twins may be 68.12 and 68.11 inches, respectively. Counts, such as population sizes, are discrete because they have to be integers—that’s how we count.1\n\rCase study: describing student heights\rHere we consider an artificial problem to help us illustrate the underlying concepts.\nPretend that we have to describe the heights of our classmates to ET, an extraterrestrial that has never seen humans. As a first step, we need to collect data. To do this, we ask students to report their heights in inches. We ask them to provide sex information because we know there are two different distributions by sex. We collect the data and save it in the heights data frame:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(heights)\rOne way to convey the heights to ET is to simply send him this list of 1050 heights. But there are much more effective ways to convey this information, and understanding the concept of a distribution will help. To simplify the explanation, we first focus on male heights.\nDistribution function\rIt turns out that, in some cases, the average and the standard deviation are pretty much all we need to understand the data. We will learn data visualization techniques that will help us determine when this two number summary is appropriate. These same techniques will serve as an alternative for when two numbers are not enough.\nThe most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. The simplest way to think of a distribution is as a compact description of a list with many entries. This concept should not be new for readers of this book. For example, with categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportion of each unique category. The sex represented in the heights dataset is:\n## ## Female Male ## 0.2266667 0.7733333\rThis two-category frequency table is the simplest form of a distribution. We don’t really need to visualize it since one number describes everything we need to know: 23% are females and the rest are males. When there are more categories, then a simple barplot describes the distribution. Here is an example with US state regions:\nThis particular plot simply shows us four numbers, one for each category. We usually use barplots to display a few numbers. Although this particular plot does not provide much more insight than a frequency table itself, it is a first example of how we convert a vector into a plot that succinctly summarizes all the information in the vector. When the data is numerical, the task of displaying distributions is more challenging.\n\rCumulative distribution functions\rNumerical data that are not categorical also have distributions. In general, when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each entry is not an effective summary since most entries are unique. In our case study, while several students reported a height of 68 inches, only one student reported a height of 68.503937007874 inches and only one student reported a height 68.8976377952756 inches. We assume that they converted from 174 and 175 centimeters, respectively.\nStatistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way to define a distribution for numeric data is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data below \\(a\\) for all possible values of \\(a\\). This function is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF). In statistics, the following notation is used:\n\\[ F(a) = \\mbox{Pr}(x \\leq a) \\]\nHere is a plot of \\(F\\) for the male height data:\nSimilar to what the frequency table does for categorical data, the CDF\rdefines the distribution for numerical data. From the plot, we can see that 16% of the values are below 65, since \\(F(66)=\\) 0.1637931, or that 84% of the values are below 72, since \\(F(72)=\\) 0.841133,\rand so on. In fact, we can report the proportion of values between any two heights, say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), by computing \\(F(b) - F(a)\\). This means that if we send this plot above to ET, he will have all the information needed to reconstruct the entire list. Paraphrasing the expression “a picture is worth a thousand words”, in this case, a picture is as informative as 812 numbers.\nA final note: because CDFs can be defined mathematically—and absent any data—the word empirical is added to make the distinction when data is used. We therefore use the term empirical CDF (eCDF).\n\r\rGeometries for describing distributions\rNow, we’ll introduce ggplot geometries useful for describing distributions (or for many other things).\nHistograms\rAlthough the CDF concept is widely discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot is actually not very popular in practice. The main reason is that it does not easily convey characteristics of interest such as: at what value is the distribution centered? Is the distribution symmetric? What ranges contain 95% of the values? I doubt you can figure these out from glancing at the plot above. Histograms are much preferred because they greatly facilitate answering such questions. Histograms sacrifice just a bit of information to produce plots that are much easier to interpret.\nThe simplest way to make a histogram is to divide the span of our data into non-overlapping bins of the same size. Then, for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval. The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar defined by the intervals. Here is the histogram for the height data splitting the range of values into one inch intervals: \\((49.5, 50.5],(50.5, 51.5],(51.5,52.5],(52.5,53.5],...,(82.5,83.5]\\)\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex==\u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;)\rIf we send this histogram plot to some uninformed reader, she will immediately learn some important properties about our data. First, the range of the data is from 50 to 84 with the majority (more than 95%) between 63 and 75 inches. Second, the heights are close to symmetric around 69 inches. Also, by adding up counts, this reader could obtain a very good approximation of the proportion of the data in any interval. Therefore, the histogram above is not only easy to interpret, but also provides almost all the information contained in the raw list of 812 heights with about 30 bin counts.\nWhat information do we lose? Note that all values in each interval are treated the same when computing bin heights. So, for example, the histogram does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches. Given that these differences are almost unnoticeable to the eye, the practical implications are negligible and we were able to summarize the data to just 23 numbers.\nThe geom_histogram layer only requires one aesthetic mapping - the x-axis. This is because the y-axis is computed from counts of the x-axis. Giving an aesthetic mapping to an additional variable for y will result in an error. Using an aesthetic mapping like fill will work - it’ll give you two histograms on top of each other. Try it! Try setting the alpha aesthetic to .5 (not an aesthetic mapping) so you can see both layers when they overlap.\n\rSmoothed density\rSmooth density plots are aesthetically more appealing than histograms. geom_density is the geometry that gives a smoothed density. Here is what a smooth density plot looks like for our heights data:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex==\u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_density(alpha = .2, fill= \u0026quot;#00BFC4\u0026quot;, color = \u0026#39;gray50\u0026#39;) \rIn this plot, we no longer have sharp edges at the interval boundaries and many of the local peaks have been removed. Also, the scale of the y-axis changed from counts to density. That is, the area under the curve will add up to 1, so we can read it like a probability density.\nTo understand the smooth densities, we have to understand estimates, a topic we don’t cover until later. However, we provide a heuristic explanation to help you understand the basics so you can use this useful data visualization tool.\nThe main new concept you must understand is that we assume that our list of observed values is a subset of a much larger list of unobserved values. In the case of heights, you can imagine that our list of 812 male students comes from a hypothetical list containing all the heights of all the male students in all the world measured very precisely. Let’s say there are 1,000,000 of these measurements. This list of values has a distribution, like any list of values, and this larger distribution is really what we want to report to ET since it is much more general. Unfortunately, we don’t get to see it.\nHowever, we make an assumption that helps us perhaps approximate it. If we had 1,000,000 values, measured very precisely, we could make a histogram with very, very small bins. The assumption is that if we show this, the height of consecutive bins will be similar. This is what we mean by smooth: we don’t have big jumps in the heights of consecutive bins. Below we have a hypothetical histogram with bins of size 1:\nThe smaller we make the bins, the smoother the histogram gets. Here are the histograms with bin width of 1, 0.5, and 0.1:\nThe smooth density is basically the curve that goes through the top of the histogram bars when the bins are very, very small. To make the curve not depend on the hypothetical size of the hypothetical list, we compute the curve on frequencies rather than counts. We do this by using the double-dot object ..density... Objects surrounded by .. are objects that are calculated by ggplot. If we look at ?geom_histogram, and go down to “Computed variables”, we see that we could use ..count.. to get “number of points in a bin”; ..ncount.. for the count scaled to a max of 1; or ..ndensity.. which scales the density to a max of 1 (which is a strange one). We can manually set the y aesthetic mapping, which defaults to ..count.., to ..density..:\nx %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height)) +\rgeom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 0.1, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) \r## Warning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\r## ℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\r## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.\r## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was\r## generated.\rNow, back to reality. We don’t have millions of measurements. In this concrete example, we have 812 and we can’t make a histogram with very small bins.\nWe therefore make a histogram, using bin sizes appropriate for our data and computing frequencies rather than counts, and we draw a smooth curve that goes through the tops of the histogram bars. The following plots (loosely) demonstrate the steps that the computer goes through to ultimately create a smooth density:\n\rInterpreting the y-axis\rNote that interpreting the y-axis of a smooth density plot is not straightforward. It is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1. If you imagine we form a bin with a base 1 unit in length, the y-axis value tells us the proportion of values in that bin. However, this is only true for bins of size 1. For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportion of data in that interval is by computing the proportion of the total area contained in that interval. For example, here are the proportion of values between 65 and 68:\nThe proportion of this area is about\r0.3,\rmeaning that about\r30%\rof male heights are between 65 and 68 inches.\nBy understanding this, we are ready to use the smooth density as a summary. For this dataset, we would feel quite comfortable with the smoothness assumption, and therefore with sharing this aesthetically pleasing figure with ET, which he could use to understand our male heights data:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex==\u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height)) +\rgeom_density(alpha=.2, fill= \u0026quot;#00BFC4\u0026quot;, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) \rNote that the only aesthetic mapping is x = height, while the fill and color are set as un-mapped aesthetics.\n\rDensities permit stratification\rAs a final note, we point out that an advantage of smooth densities over histograms for visualization purposes is that densities make it easier to compare two distributions. This is in large part because the jagged edges of the histogram add clutter. Here is an example comparing male and female heights:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height, fill=sex)) +\rgeom_density(alpha = 0.2, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;)\rWith the right argument, ggplot automatically shades the intersecting region with a different color.\n\r\rThe normal distribution\rHistograms and density plots provide excellent summaries of a distribution. But can we summarize even further? We often see the average and standard deviation used as summary statistics: a two-number summary! To understand what these summaries are and why they are so widely used, we need to understand the normal distribution.\nThe normal distribution, also known as the bell curve and as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most famous mathematical concepts in history. A reason for this is that approximately normal distributions occur in many situations, including gambling winnings, heights, weights, blood pressure, standardized test scores, and experimental measurement errors. There are explanations for this, but we describe these later. Here we focus on how the normal distribution helps us summarize data.\nRather than using data, the normal distribution is defined with a mathematical formula. For any interval \\((a,b)\\), the proportion of values in that interval can be computed using this formula:\n\\[\\mbox{Pr}(a \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; b) = \\int_a^b \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}s} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{x-m}{s} \\right)^2} \\, dx\\]\nYou don’t need to memorize or understand the details of the formula. But note that it is completely defined by just two parameters: \\(m\\) and \\(s\\). The rest of the symbols in the formula represent the interval ends that we determine, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and known mathematical constants \\(\\pi\\) and \\(e\\). These two parameters, \\(m\\) and \\(s\\), are referred to as the average (also called the mean) and the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution, respectively.\nThe distribution is symmetric, centered at the average, and most values (about 95%) are within 2 SDs from the average. Here is what the normal distribution looks like when the average is 0 and the SD is 1:\nThe fact that the distribution is defined by just two parameters implies that if a dataset is approximated by a normal distribution, all the information needed to describe the distribution can be encoded in just two numbers: the average and the standard deviation. We now define these values for an arbitrary list of numbers.\nFor a list of numbers contained in a vector x, the average is defined as:\nm \u0026lt;- sum(x) / length(x)\rand the SD is defined as:\ns \u0026lt;- sqrt(sum((x-mu)^2) / length(x))\rwhich can be interpreted as the average distance between values and their average.\nLet’s compute the values for the height for males which we will store in the object \\(x\\):\nindex \u0026lt;- heights$sex == \u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;\rx \u0026lt;- heights$height[index]\rThe pre-built functions mean and sd (note that for reasons explained later, sd divides by length(x)-1 rather than length(x)) can be used here:\nm \u0026lt;- mean(x)\rs \u0026lt;- sd(x)\rc(average = m, sd = s)\r## average sd ## 69.314755 3.611024\rHere is a plot of the smooth density and the normal distribution with mean = 69.3 and SD = 3.6 plotted as a black line with our student height smooth density in blue:\nNow, we can ask the question “is our height data approximately normally distributed?”. The normal distribution does appear to be quite a good approximation here. We now will see how well this approximation works at predicting the proportion of values within intervals.\nStandard units\rFor data that is approximately normally distributed, it is convenient to think in terms of standard units. The standard unit of a value tells us how many standard deviations away from the average it is. Specifically, for a value x from a vector X, we define the value of x in standard units as z = (x - m)/s with m and s the average and standard deviation of X, respectively. Why is this convenient?\nFirst look back at the formula for the normal distribution and note that what is being exponentiated is \\(-z^2/2\\) with \\(z\\) equivalent to \\(x\\) in standard units. Because the maximum of \\(e^{-z^2/2}\\) is when \\(z=0\\), this explains why the maximum of the distribution occurs at the average. It also explains the symmetry since \\(- z^2/2\\) is symmetric around 0. Second, note that if we convert the normally distributed data to standard units, we can quickly know if, for example, a person is about average (\\(z=0\\)), one of the largest (\\(z \\approx 2\\)), one of the smallest (\\(z \\approx -2\\)), or an extremely rare occurrence (\\(z \u0026gt; 3\\) or \\(z \u0026lt; -3\\)). Remember that it does not matter what the original units are, these rules apply to any data that is approximately normal.\nIn R, we can obtain standard units using the function scale:\nz \u0026lt;- scale(x)\rNow to see how many men are within 2 SDs from the average, we simply type:\nmean(abs(z) \u0026lt; 2)\r## [1] 0.9495074\rThe proportion is about 95%, which is what the normal distribution predicts! To further confirm that, in fact, the approximation is a good one, we can use quantile-quantile plots.\n\rQuantile-quantile plots\rA systematic way to assess how well the normal distribution fits the data is to check if the observed and predicted proportions match. In general, this is the approach of the quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot). If our heights distribution is really normal, then the 10th percentile of our heights data should be the same as the 10th percentile of a theoretical normal, as should the 20th, 30th, 33rd, 37.5th, etc. percentiles.\nFirst let’s define the theoretical quantiles (percentiles) for the normal distribution. In statistics books we use the symbol \\(\\Phi(x)\\) to define the function that gives us the probability of a standard normal distribution being smaller than \\(x\\). So, for example, \\(\\Phi(-1.96) = 0.025\\) and \\(\\Phi(1.96) = 0.975\\). In R, we can evaluate \\(\\Phi\\) using the pnorm function:\npnorm(-1.96)\r## [1] 0.0249979\rThe inverse function \\(\\Phi^{-1}(x)\\) gives us the theoretical quantiles for the normal distribution. So, for example, \\(\\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96\\). In R, we can evaluate the inverse of \\(\\Phi\\) using the qnorm function.\nqnorm(0.975)\r## [1] 1.959964\rNote that these calculations are for the standard normal distribution by default (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), but we can also define these for any normal distribution. We can do this using the mean and sd arguments in the pnorm and qnorm function. For example, we can use qnorm to determine quantiles of a distribution with a specific average and standard deviation\nqnorm(0.975, mean = 5, sd = 2)\r## [1] 8.919928\rFor the normal distribution, all the calculations related to quantiles are done without data, thus the name theoretical quantiles. But quantiles can be defined for any distribution, including an empirical one. So if we have data in a vector \\(x\\), we can define the quantile associated with any proportion \\(p\\) as the \\(q\\) for which the proportion of values below \\(q\\) is \\(p\\). Using R code, we can define q as the value for which mean(x \u0026lt;= q) = p. Notice that not all \\(p\\) have a \\(q\\) for which the proportion is exactly \\(p\\). There are several ways of defining the best \\(q\\) as discussed in the help for the quantile function.\nTo give a quick example, for the male heights data, we have that:\nmean(x \u0026lt;= 69.5)\r## [1] 0.5147783\rSo about 50% are shorter or equal to 69 inches. This implies that if \\(p=0.50\\) then \\(q=69.5\\).\nThe idea of a QQ-plot is that if your data is well approximated by normal distribution then the quantiles of your data should be similar to the quantiles of a normal distribution. To construct a QQ-plot, we do the following:\nDefine a vector of \\(m\\) proportions \\(p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m\\).\rDefine a vector of quantiles \\(q_1, \\dots, q_m\\) for your data for the proportions \\(p_1, \\dots, p_m\\). We refer to these as the sample quantiles.\rDefine a vector of theoretical quantiles for the proportions \\(p_1, \\dots, p_m\\) for a normal distribution with the same average and standard deviation as the data.\rPlot the sample quantiles versus the theoretical quantiles.\r\rLet’s construct a QQ-plot using R code. Start by defining the vector of proportions.\np \u0026lt;- seq(0.005, 0.995, 0.01)\rTo obtain the quantiles from the data, we can use the quantile function like this:\nsample_quantiles \u0026lt;- quantile(x, p)\rTo obtain the theoretical normal distribution quantiles with the corresponding average and SD, we use the qnorm function:\ntheoretical_quantiles \u0026lt;- qnorm(p, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))\rdf = data.frame(sample_quantiles, theoretical_quantiles)\rTo see if they match or not, we plot them against each other and draw the identity line:\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = theoretical_quantiles, y = sample_quantiles)) + geom_point() + geom_abline() # a 45-degree line \rNotice that this code becomes much cleaner if we use standard units:\nsample_quantiles \u0026lt;- quantile(z, p)\rtheoretical_quantiles \u0026lt;- qnorm(p)\rdf2 = data.frame(sample_quantiles, theoretical_quantiles)\rggplot(data = df2, aes(x = theoretical_quantiles, y = sample_quantiles)) + geom_point() + geom_abline()\rThe above code is included to help describe QQ-plots. However, in practice it is easier to use the ggplot geometry geom_qq:\nheights %\u0026gt;% filter(sex == \u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) +\rgeom_qq() +\rgeom_abline()\rWhile for the illustration above we used 100 quantiles, the default from the geom_qq function is to use as many quantiles as data points.\n\rPercentiles\rBefore we move on, let’s define some terms that are commonly used in exploratory data analysis.\nPercentiles are special cases of quantiles that are commonly used. The percentiles are the quantiles you obtain when setting the \\(p\\) at \\(0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99\\). We call, for example, the case of \\(p=0.25\\) the 25th percentile, which gives us a number for which 25% of the data is below. The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the median.\nFor the normal distribution the median and average are the same, but this is generally not the case.\nAnother special case that receives a name are the quartiles, which are obtained when setting \\(p=0.25,0.50\\), and \\(0.75\\).\n\r\rggplot2 geometries\rAlhough we haven’t gone into detain about the ggplot2 package for data visualization, we now will briefly discuss some of the geometries involved in the plots above. We will discuss ggplot2 in (excruciating) detail later this week. For now, we will briefly demonstrate how to generate plots related to distributions.\nBarplots\rTo generate a barplot we can use the geom_bar geometry. The default is to count the number of each category and draw a bar. Here is the plot for the regions of the US.\nmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(region)) + geom_bar()\rWe often already have a table with a distribution that we want to present as a barplot. Here is an example of such a table:\ndata(murders)\rtab \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;%\rcount(region) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(proportion = n/sum(n))\rtab\r## region n proportion\r## 1 Northeast 9 0.1764706\r## 2 South 17 0.3333333\r## 3 North Central 12 0.2352941\r## 4 West 13 0.2549020\rWe no longer want geom_bar to count, but rather just plot a bar to the height provided by the proportion variable. For this we need to provide x (the categories) and y (the values) and use the stat=\"identity\" option. This tells R to just use the actual value in proportion for the y aesthetic. This is only necessary when you’re telling R that you have your own field (proportion) that you want to use instead of just the count.\ntab %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = region, y = proportion)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;)\r\rHistograms\rTo generate histograms we use geom_histogram. By looking at the help file for this function, we learn that the only required argument is x, the variable for which we will construct a histogram. We dropped the x because we know it is the first argument.\rThe code looks like this:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_histogram()\rIf we run the code above, it gives us a message:\n\rstat_bin() using bins = 30. Pick better value with\rbinwidth.\n\rWe previously used a bin size of 1 inch (of observed height), so the code looks like this:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\rFinally, if for aesthetic reasons we want to add color, we use the arguments described in the help file. We also add labels and a title:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Male heights in inches\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Histogram\u0026quot;)\r\rDensity plots\rTo create a smooth density, we use the geom_density. To make a smooth density plot with the data previously shown as a histogram we can use this code:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height)) +\rgeom_density()\rTo fill in with color, we can use the fill argument.\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height)) +\rgeom_density(fill=\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;)\rTo change the smoothness of the density, we use the adjust argument to multiply the default value by that adjust. For example, if we want the bandwidth to be twice as big we use:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height)) + geom_density(fill=\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, adjust = 2)\r\rBoxplots\rThe geometry for boxplot is geom_boxplot. As discussed, boxplots are useful for comparing distributions. For example, below are the previously shown heights for women, but compared to men. For this geometry, we need arguments x as the categories, and y as the values.\nNote that our x-axis is a categorical variable. The order is determined by either the factor variable levels in heights or, if no levels are set, in the order in which the sex variable first encounters them. Later on, we’ll learn how to change the ordering.\nWe can do much more with boxplots when we have more data. Right now, our heights data has only two variables - sex and height. Let’s say we took the measurements over two different years - 2010 and 2020. That’s not in our data, so purely for exposition, we’ll add it by randomly drawing a year for each observation. We’ll do this with sample\nheights = heights %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(year = sample(x = c(2010, 2020), size = n(), replace = TRUE, prob = c(.5, .5)))\rhead(heights)\r## sex height year\r## 1 Male 75 2020\r## 2 Male 70 2010\r## 3 Male 68 2020\r## 4 Male 74 2010\r## 5 Male 61 2020\r## 6 Female 65 2010\rNow, let’s look at the boxplot of heights by sex, but broken out by year. We can do this by adding year as an aesthetic mapping. Because our year variable is an integer, R will start by thinking it’s a continuous numeric, but we want to treat it as a discrete variable. So, we wrap it in as.factor() to force R to recognize it as a discrete variable.\nheights %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = height, fill = as.factor(year))) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rlabs(fill = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;)\rNow we have each sex broken out by year! Since we randomly assigned year to our data (and didn’t actually take samples in two different decades), the distribution between years and within sex is nearly identical.\nWhat if we wanted to have year on the x-axis, but then put the sex boxplots next to each other. This would let us compare the difference in heights by sex over the two sample years.\nheights %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = height, fill = sex)) + geom_boxplot() +\rlabs(fill = \u0026#39;Sex\u0026#39;)\rWoah. Wait. What? Remember, in our data, class(heights$year) is numeric, so when we ask R to put year on the x-axis, it thinks it’s plotting a number. It gives us a nonsense x-axis. How do we fix this? We force as.factor(year) to tell R that yes, year is a categorical variable. Note that we didn’t have to use as.factor(sex) - that’s because sex is already a categorical variable.\nheights %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = height, fill = sex)) + geom_boxplot() +\rlabs(fill = \u0026#39;Sex\u0026#39;)\rNow we can see the height difference by sex, by year.\nWe will explore more with boxplots and colors in our next lecture.\n](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/SSC442+-+Example+02+-+Jan+27th/1_m4no05nj?st=675) --\r\r\rTry it!\rTry it!\nTRY IT\nStart by loading the dplyr and ggplot2 library as well as the murders and heights data.\nlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(heights)\rdata(murders)\rFirst, create a new variable in murders that has murders_per_capita.\r\rmurders = murders %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(........)\rMake a histogram of murders per capita. Use the default values for color and fill, but make sure you label the x-axis with a meaningful label.\n\rMake the same histogram, but set the fill aesthetic to MSU Green and the color to black.\n\rDo the same, but make it a smooth density plot\n\rFinally, plot the smooth density but use a fill aesthetic mapping so that each region’s density is shown. Set a meaningful title on the legend, and make sure you make the density transparent so we can see all of the region’s densities (see alpha aesthetic).\n\rNow, try making a boxplot to show the same data - the distribution across states of murders per capita by region. What is the average Northeastern state’s murder rate? What about the average Southern state?\n\r\r\r\r\r\rKeep in mind that discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal. Although this is technically true, we usually reserve the term ordinal data for variables belonging to a small number of different groups, with each group having many members. In contrast, when we have many groups with few cases in each group, we typically refer to them as discrete numerical variables. So, for example, the number of packs of cigarettes a person smokes a day, rounded to the closest pack, would be considered ordinal, while the actual number of cigarettes would be considered a numerical variable. But, indeed, there are examples that can be considered both numerical and ordinal when it comes to visualizing data.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":1692576000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692645889,"objectID":"ce879375c9ab42490f4d0d112e48c07c","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/02-example/","section":"example","summary":"Visualizing data distributions\r\rVariable types\rCase study: describing student heights\r\rDistribution function\rCumulative distribution functions\r\rGeometries for describing distributions\r\rHistograms\rSmoothed density\rInterpreting the y-axis\rDensities permit stratification\r\rThe normal distribution\r\rStandard units\rQuantile-quantile plots\rPercentiles\r\rggplot2 geometries\r\rBarplots\rHistograms\rDensity plots\rBoxplots\r\rTry it!\r\r\r\rVisualizing data distributions\rThroughout your education, you may have noticed that numerical data is often summarized with the average value.","tags":null,"title":"ggplot2: Everything you ever wanted to know","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r\rAdding graphics to an Rmarkdown file\r\rFrom the web\rImages inserted in code chunks\rImages inserted via Markdown\rImages from a local file\r\rData visualization in practice\r\rCase study: new insights on poverty\r\rExploring the Data\rSlope charts\rBland-Altman plot\rBump charts\rThemes\rSmall multiples\rSparklines\r\rThe ecological fallacy and importance of showing the data\r\rLogit transformation\rShow the data\r\rCase study: vaccines and infectious diseases\rTRY IT\r\r\r\rAdding graphics to an Rmarkdown file\rFrom the web\rIf you are incorporating an image (.png or .jpg) from another site on the web, you can refer to the image directly *provided the web address ends in .png or .jpg or .gif. Google image search makes it a little hard to get directly to the image source, so click through a search until you get to the original image. Once you’re there, right-click on the image and select “Copy Image Address” (may vary by system). If you can paste the URL into a new window and get the image itself, you’re good to go with the instructions here. Some sites and formats do not host the images as a separate file – they may be generated by an app. For instance, if we go to https://msu.edu/students, the background image address is not available by right-clicking. But scrolling down, the image for the Student Information System is https://student.msu.edu/. In cases where the image address is not readily available, you’ll have to take a screenshot and use the instructions in the next section (or dig into the site code if you know how to do that sort of thing). Let’s work on getting this image into our output: https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg.\nNote that using a web address for an image means if the image owner changes the address or removes the image, you won’t be able to re-knit your document. See the next section for downloading the image and inserting into your document.\nThere are two ways of inserting an image: in markdown text, or in a code chunk. Both work. I prefer using the code chunk method, which uses knitr::include_graphics. This is an R function, so you use it inside a code chunk. When you are including an image inside a code chunk, the code chunk options can be used to control the fig.width or fig.height, and fig.align. For instance, fig.width = '75%' will use 75% of the available page width, whatever it may be. The down side is that you have to pull a copy of the image from the web and save it locally (earlier versions of Rmarkdown would do this for you automatically, but this feature was removed in rmarkdown v1.6 for security reasons). Here’s the code to do so:\n\rImages inserted in code chunks\r```\r{r insert-image, fig.width = \u0026#39;75%\u0026#39;, fig.align=\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, echo = TRUE, eval = F}\rdownload.file(\u0026quot;https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg\u0026quot;, destfile = \u0026#39;temporary.jpg\u0026#39;)\rknitr::include_graphics(path = \u0026#39;temporary.jpg\u0026#39;)\r```\rThe file you specify with destfile doesn’t matter - R will create that file, but you do need to use the corresponding suffix (don’t use temporary.jpg if you’re downloading a .png). By default, the file will be saved in the same folder as your .rmd file. When include_graphics goes to read the file, it will start looking relative to the folder that contains your .rmd file. That is, download.file will copy the image to the same place that include_graphics looks for it. See below for more on relative filepaths.\n\rImages inserted via Markdown\rThe markdown language is what controls the text outside of the R code chunks. It has its own way of inserting images. Here the image is inserted in the text, not in a code chunk.\n![](https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg\u0026quot;)\r\rImages from a local file\rWhether you have the file on your hard drive already, right-click and download from the web to keep a copy for posterity, or save the image from a screenshot, you will often need to insert an image from a local file. In Rmarkdown, the path will always be relative to the folder containing your .Rmd file. So if you keep your .Rmd in /Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3 and you have a folder /Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3/images that contains a file picture.png, then you would tell Rmarkdown to find the file at ./images/picture.png (which implies its filepath is /Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3/images/picture.png). The ./ tells R to start looking in the local directory holding the .Rmd file you’re working on.\nOnce you know your local relative path, you can use either of the above methods knitr::include_graphics('./images/picture.png') or ![](./images/picture.png).\nIt is possible for R to find your image with an incorrect filepath when you click the “run chunk” button, but then not be able to find it when you knit. This can be very frustrating. It is almost always because you do not have the right relative filepath.\n\r\rData visualization in practice\rIn this chapter, we will demonstrate how relatively simple ggplot2 code can create insightful and aesthetically pleasing plots. As motivation we will create plots that help us better understand trends in world health and economics. We will implement what we learned in previous sections of the class and learn how to augment the code to perfect the plots. As we go through our case study, we will describe relevant general data visualization principles.\nCase study: new insights on poverty\rHans Rosling1 was the co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation2, an organization dedicated to educating the public by using data to dispel common myths about the so-called developing world. The organization uses data to show how actual trends in health and economics contradict the narratives that emanate from sensationalist media coverage of catastrophes, tragedies, and other unfortunate events. As stated in the Gapminder Foundation’s website:\n\rJournalists and lobbyists tell dramatic stories. That’s their job. They tell stories about extraordinary events and unusual people. The piles of dramatic stories pile up in peoples’ minds into an over-dramatic worldview and strong negative stress feelings: “The world is getting worse!”, “It’s we vs. them!”, “Other people are strange!”, “The population just keeps growing!” and “Nobody cares!”\n\rHans Rosling conveyed actual data-based trends in a dramatic way of his own, using effective data visualization. This section is based on two talks that exemplify this approach to education: [New Insights on Poverty]3 and The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen4. Specifically, in this section, we use data to attempt to answer the following two questions:\nIs it a fair characterization of today’s world to say it is divided into western rich nations and the developing world in Africa, Asia, and Latin America?\rHas income inequality across countries worsened during the last 40 years?\r\rTo answer these questions, we will be using the gapminder dataset provided in dslabs. This dataset was created using a number of spreadsheets available from the Gapminder Foundation. You can access the table like this:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rlibrary(ggrepel)\rlibrary(ggthemes)\rgapminder = dslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;% as_tibble()\rExploring the Data\rTaking an exercise from the New Insights on Poverty video, we start by testing our knowledge regarding differences in child mortality across different countries. For each of the six pairs of countries below, which country do you think had the highest child mortality rates in 2015? Which pairs do you think are most similar?\nSri Lanka or Turkey\rPoland or South Korea\rMalaysia or Russia\rPakistan or Vietnam\rThailand or South Africa\r\rWhen answering these questions without data, the non-European countries are typically picked as having higher child mortality rates: Sri Lanka over Turkey, South Korea over Poland, and Malaysia over Russia. It is also common to assume that countries considered to be part of the developing world: Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, and South Africa, have similarly high mortality rates.\nTo answer these questions with data, we can use dplyr. For example, for the first comparison we see that:\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year == 2015 \u0026amp; country %in% c(\u0026quot;Sri Lanka\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Turkey\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(country, infant_mortality)\r## country infant_mortality\r## 1 Sri Lanka 8.4\r## 2 Turkey 11.6\rTurkey has the higher infant mortality rate.\nWe can use this code on all comparisons and find the following:\n\r\rcountry\r\rinfant mortality\r\rcountry\r\rinfant mortality\r\r\r\r\r\rSri Lanka\r\r8.4\r\rTurkey\r\r11.6\r\r\r\rPoland\r\r4.5\r\rSouth Korea\r\r2.9\r\r\r\rMalaysia\r\r6.0\r\rRussia\r\r8.2\r\r\r\rPakistan\r\r65.8\r\rVietnam\r\r17.3\r\r\r\rThailand\r\r10.5\r\rSouth Africa\r\r33.6\r\r\r\r\rWe see that the European countries on this list have higher child mortality rates: Poland has a higher rate than South Korea, and Russia has a higher rate than Malaysia. We also see that Pakistan has a much higher rate than Vietnam, and South Africa has a much higher rate than Thailand. It turns out that when Hans Rosling gave this quiz to educated groups of people, the average score was less than 2.5 out of 5, worse than what they would have obtained had they guessed randomly. This implies that more than ignorant, we are misinformed. In this chapter we see how data visualization helps inform us.\n\rSlope charts\rThe slopechart is informative when you are comparing variables of the same type, but at different time points and for a relatively small number of comparisons. For example, comparing life expectancy between 2010 and 2015. In this case, we might recommend a slope chart.\nThere is no geometry for slope charts in ggplot2, but we can construct one using geom_line. We need to do some tinkering to add labels. We’ll paste together a character stright with the country name and the starting life expectancy, then do the same with just the later life expectancy for the right side. Below is an example comparing 2010 to 2015 for large western countries:\nwest \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Western Europe\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Northern Europe\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Southern Europe\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Northern America\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Australia and New Zealand\u0026quot;)\rdat \u0026lt;- gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) \u0026amp; region %in% west \u0026amp;\r!is.na(life_expectancy) \u0026amp; population \u0026gt; 10^7) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(label_first = ifelse(year == 2010, paste0(country, \u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, round(life_expectancy, 1), \u0026#39; years\u0026#39;), NA),\rlabel_last = ifelse(year == 2015, paste0(round(life_expectancy, 1),\u0026#39; years\u0026#39;), NA))\rdat %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(location = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 2),\rlocation = ifelse(year == 2015 \u0026amp;\rcountry %in% c(\u0026quot;United Kingdom\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Portugal\u0026quot;),\rlocation+0.22, location),\rhjust = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 0)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(year = as.factor(year)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group = country)) +\rgeom_line(aes(color = country), show.legend = FALSE) +\rgeom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first, color = country), direction = \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;, nudge_x = -1, seed = 1234, show.legend = FALSE) +\rgeom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last, color = country), direction = \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;, nudge_x = 1, seed = 1234, show.legend = FALSE) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Life Expectancy\u0026quot;)\rAn advantage of the slope chart is that it permits us to quickly get an idea of changes based on the slope of the lines. Although we are using angle as the visual cue, we also have position to determine the exact values. Comparing the improvements is a bit harder with a scatterplot:\nIn the scatterplot, we have followed the principle use common axes since we are comparing these before and after. However, if we have many points, slope charts stop being useful as it becomes hard to see all the lines.\n\rBland-Altman plot\rSince we are primarily interested in the difference, it makes sense to dedicate one of our axes to it. The Bland-Altman plot, also known as the Tukey mean-difference plot and the MA-plot, shows the difference versus the average:\ndat %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(year = paste0(\u0026quot;life_expectancy_\u0026quot;, year)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(country, year, life_expectancy) %\u0026gt;%\rspread(year, life_expectancy) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(average = (life_expectancy_2015 + life_expectancy_2010)/2,\rdifference = life_expectancy_2015 - life_expectancy_2010) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(average, difference, label = country)) +\rgeom_point() +\rgeom_text_repel() +\rgeom_abline(lty = 2) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;Average of 2010 and 2015\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Difference between 2015 and 2010\u0026quot;)\rHere, by simply looking at the y-axis, we quickly see which countries have shown the most improvement. We also get an idea of the overall value from the x-axis. You already made a similar Altman plot in an earlier problem set, so we’ll move on.\n\rBump charts\rFinally, we can make a bump chart that shows changes in rankings over time. We’ll look at fertility in South Asia. First we need to calculate a new variable that shows the rank of each country within each year. We can do this if we group by year and then use the rank() function to rank countries by the fertility column.\nsa_fe \u0026lt;- gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(region == \u0026quot;Southern Asia\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year \u0026gt;= 2004, year \u0026lt; 2015) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(year) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(rank = rank(fertility))\rWe then plot this with points and lines, reversing the y-axis so 1 is at the top:\nggplot(sa_fe, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +\rgeom_line() +\rgeom_point() +\rscale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:8)\rIran holds the number 1 spot, while Sri Lanka dropped from 2 to 6, and Bangladesh increased from 4 to 2.\nAs with the slopegraph, there are 8 different colors in the legend and it’s hard to line them all up with the different lines, so we can plot the text directly instead. We’ll use geom_text() again. We don’t need to repel anything, since the text should fit in each row just fine. We need to change the data argument in geom_text() though and filter the data to only include one year, otherwise we’ll get labels on every point, which is excessive. We can also adjust the theme and colors to make it cleaner.\nbumpplot \u0026lt;- ggplot(sa_fe, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +\rgeom_line(size = 2) +\rgeom_point(size = 4) +\rgeom_text(data = sa_fe %\u0026gt;% dplyr::filter(year==2004) %\u0026gt;% arrange(rank),\raes(label = country, x = 2003), fontface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, angle = 45) +\rgeom_text(data = sa_fe %\u0026gt;% dplyr::filter(year==2014) %\u0026gt;% arrange(rank),\raes(label = country, x = 2015), fontface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, angle = 45) + guides(color = FALSE) +\rscale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:8) +\rscale_x_continuous(breaks = 2004:2014) +\rscale_color_viridis_d(option = \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, begin = 0.2, end = 0.9) +\rlabs(x = NULL, y = \u0026quot;Rank\u0026quot;)\rbumpplot\rIf you want to be super fancy, you can use flags instead of country codes, but that’s a little more complicated (you need to install the ggflags package. See here for an example.\n\rThemes\rWe can go a little further towards a clean, easy-to-read data visualization by using themes in our plots. Themes allow us to set a particular range of plot settings in one command, and let us further tweak things like fonts, background colors, and much more. We’ve used them in passing a few times without highlighting them, but we’ll discuss them here.\nA pre-constructed set of instructions for making a visual theme can be had by using a theme’s ggplot function. Let’s look at two of my favorites.\ntheme_bw() uses the black-and-white theme, which is helpful in making a nice, clean plot:\nbumpplot + theme_bw()\rThe background shading is gone, which gives the plot a nice, crisp feel. It adds the black outline around the plot, but doesn’t mess with the colors in the plot.\nHere’s theme_minimal()\nbumpplot + theme_minimal()\rThemes can alter things in the plot as well. If we really want to strip it down and remove the Y-axis (which is rarely a good idea, but in a bump chart, it makes sense):\nbumpplot + theme_void()\rNow that’s clean!\nIn our opening unit, we had a plot that was styled after the plots in the magazine, The Economist. That’s a theme (in the ggthemes package that we loaded at the top)!\nbumpplot + theme_economist()\rThemes affect some of the plot elements that we haven’t gotten much into (like length of axis ticks and the color of the panel grid behind the plot). We can use a theme, then make further changes to the theme. We won’t go into a lot of detail, but here’s an example. Use the ?theme to learn more about what you can change. Half the challenge is finding the right term for the thing you want to tweak! Theme changes occur in code order, so you can update a pre-set theme with your own details:\nbumpplot + theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = element_text(face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\raxis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\rpanel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), # turn off all of the Y grid\rpanel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\rpanel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) # turn off small x grid\r\rSmall multiples\rFirst we can make some small multiples plots and show life expectancy over time for a handful of countries. We’ll make a list of some countries chosen at random while I scrolled through the data, and then filter our data to include only those rows. We then plot life expectancy, faceting by country.\nlife_expectancy_small \u0026lt;- gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(country %in% c(\u0026quot;Argentina\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bolivia\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Brazil\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Belize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Canada\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Chile\u0026quot;))\rggplot(data = life_expectancy_small,\rmapping = aes(x = year, y = life_expectancy)) +\rgeom_line(size = 1) +\rfacet_wrap(vars(country))\rSmall multiples!

We have seen that, on average, some regions do better than others. In this section, we focus on describing the importance of variability within the groups when examining the relationship between a country’s infant mortality rates and average income.\nWe define a few more regions and compare the averages across regions:\nThe relationship between these two variables is almost perfectly linear and the graph shows a dramatic difference. While in the West less than 0.5% of infants die, in Sub-Saharan Africa the rate is higher than 6%!\nNote that the plot uses a new transformation, the logit transformation.\nLogit transformation\rThe logit transformation for a proportion or rate \\(p\\) is defined as:\n\\[f(p) = \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1-p} \\right)\\]\nWhen \\(p\\) is a proportion or probability, the quantity that is being logged, \\(p/(1-p)\\), is called the odds. In this case \\(p\\) is the proportion of infants that survived. The odds tell us how many more infants are expected to survive than to die. The log transformation makes this symmetric. If the rates are the same, then the log odds is 0. Fold increases or decreases turn into positive and negative increments, respectively.\nThis scale is useful when we want to highlight differences near 0 or 1. For survival rates this is important because a survival rate of 90% is unacceptable, while a survival of 99% is relatively good. We would much prefer a survival rate closer to 99.9%. We want our scale to highlight these difference and the logit does this. Note that 99.9/0.1 is about 10 times bigger than 99/1 which is about 10 times larger than 90/10. By using the log, these fold changes turn into constant increases.\n\rShow the data\rNow, back to our plot. Based on the plot above, do we conclude that a country with a low income is destined to have low survival rate? Do we conclude that survival rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are all lower than in Southern Asia, which in turn are lower than in the Pacific Islands, and so on?\nJumping to this conclusion based on a plot showing averages is referred to as the ecological fallacy. The almost perfect relationship between survival rates and income is only observed for the averages at the region level. Once we show all the data, we see a somewhat more complicated story:\nSpecifically, we see that there is a large amount of variability. We see that countries from the same regions can be quite different and that countries with the same income can have different survival rates. For example, while on average Sub-Saharan Africa had the worse health and economic outcomes, there is wide variability within that group. Mauritius and Botswana are doing better than Angola and Sierra Leone, with Mauritius comparable to Western countries.\n\r\rCase study: vaccines and infectious diseases\rVaccines have helped save millions of lives. In the 19th century, before herd immunization was achieved through vaccination programs, deaths from infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio, were common. However, today vaccination programs have become somewhat controversial despite all the scientific evidence for their importance.\nThe controversy started with a paper5 published in 1988 and led by Andrew Wakefield claiming\rthere was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the appearance of autism and bowel disease.\rDespite much scientific evidence contradicting this finding, sensationalist media reports and fear-mongering from conspiracy theorists led parts of the public into believing that vaccines were harmful. As a result, many parents ceased to vaccinate their children. This dangerous practice can be potentially disastrous given that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that vaccinations will prevent more than 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years (see Benefits from Immunization during the Vaccines for Children Program Era — United States, 1994-2013, MMWR6).\rThe 1988 paper has since been retracted and Andrew Wakefield was eventually “struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and was thereby barred from practicing medicine in the UK.” (source: Wikipedia7). Yet misconceptions persist, in part due to self-proclaimed activists who continue to disseminate misinformation about vaccines.\nEffective communication of data is a strong antidote to misinformation and fear-mongering. Earlier we used an example provided by a Wall Street Journal article8 showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases. Here we reconstruct that example.\nThe data used for these plots were collected, organized, and distributed by the Tycho Project9. They include weekly reported counts for seven diseases from 1928 to 2011, from all fifty states. The yearly totals are helpfully included in the dslabs package:\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\rdata(us_contagious_diseases)\rnames(us_contagious_diseases)\r## [1] \u0026quot;disease\u0026quot; \u0026quot;state\u0026quot; \u0026quot;year\u0026quot; \u0026quot;weeks_reporting\u0026quot;\r## [5] \u0026quot;count\u0026quot; \u0026quot;population\u0026quot;\rWe create a temporary object dat that stores only the measles data, includes a per 100,000 rate, orders states by average value of disease and removes Alaska and Hawaii since they only became states in the late 1950s. Note that there is a weeks_reporting column that tells us for how many weeks of the year data was reported. We have to adjust for that value when computing the rate.\nthe_disease \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;Measles\u0026quot;\rdat \u0026lt;- us_contagious_diseases %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(!state%in%c(\u0026quot;Hawaii\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Alaska\u0026quot;) \u0026amp; disease == the_disease) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(rate = count / population * 10000 * 52 / weeks_reporting) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(state = reorder(state, rate))\rWe can now easily plot disease rates per year. Here are the measles data from California:\ndat %\u0026gt;% filter(state == \u0026quot;California\u0026quot; \u0026amp; !is.na(rate)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(year, rate)) +\rgeom_line() +\rylab(\u0026quot;Cases per 10,000\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;)\rWe add a vertical line at 1963 since this is when the vaccine was introduced [Control, Centers for Disease; Prevention (2014). CDC health information for international travel 2014 (the yellow book). p. 250. ISBN 9780199948505].\nNow can we show data for all states in one plot? We have three variables to show: year, state, and rate. In the WSJ figure, they use the x-axis for year, the y-axis for state, and color hue to represent rates. However, the color scale they use, which goes from yellow to blue to green to orange to red, can be improved.\nIn our example, we want to use a sequential palette since there is no meaningful center, just low and high rates.\nWe use the geometry geom_tile to tile the region with colors representing disease rates. We use a square root transformation to avoid having the really high counts dominate the plot. Notice that missing values are shown in grey. Note that once a disease was pretty much eradicated, some states stopped reporting cases all together. This is why we see so much grey after 1980.\ndat %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(year, state, fill = rate)) +\rgeom_tile(color = \u0026quot;grey50\u0026quot;) +\rscale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +\rscale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, \u0026quot;Reds\u0026quot;), trans = \u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal() +\rtheme(panel.grid = element_blank(),\rlegend.position=\u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;,\rtext = element_text(size = 8)) +\rggtitle(the_disease) +\rylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)\rThis plot makes a very striking argument for the contribution of vaccines. However, one limitation of this plot is that it uses color to represent quantity, which we earlier explained makes it harder to know exactly how high values are going. Position and lengths are better cues. If we are willing to lose state information, we can make a version of the plot that shows the values with position. We can also show the average for the US, which we compute like this:\navg \u0026lt;- us_contagious_diseases %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(disease==the_disease) %\u0026gt;% group_by(year) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(us_rate = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE) /\rsum(population, na.rm = TRUE) * 10000)\rNow to make the plot we simply use the geom_line geometry:\ndat %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(!is.na(rate)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() +\rgeom_line(aes(year, rate, group = state), color = \u0026quot;grey50\u0026quot;,\rshow.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +\rgeom_line(mapping = aes(year, us_rate), data = avg, size = 1) +\rscale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;, breaks = c(5, 25, 125, 300)) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Cases per 10,000 by state\u0026quot;) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_text(data = data.frame(x = 1955, y = 50),\rmapping = aes(x, y, label=\u0026quot;US average\u0026quot;),\rcolor=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;)\rIn theory, we could use color to represent the categorical value state, but it is hard to pick 50 distinct colors.\n\rTRY IT\rTRY IT\nReproduce the heatmap plot we previously made but for smallpox. For this plot, do not include years in which cases were not reported in 10 or more weeks.\n\rNow reproduce the time series plot we previously made, but this time following the instructions of the previous question for smallpox.\n\rFor the state of California, make a time series plot showing rates for all diseases. Include only years with 10 or more weeks reporting. Use a different color for each disease.\n\rNow do the same for the rates for the US.

See the Installing page of our course resources for instructions.\nI have created a video walkthrough for the basics of using R for another course, but it is useful here. You can see part A here (labeled “Part 2a”) here ] and part B here (labeled “Part 2b”) . You should already be at this level of familiarity with R, but if you need a review, this is a good place to start.\nProgramming basics\rWe teach R because it greatly facilitates data analysis, the main topic of this book. By coding in R, we can efficiently perform exploratory data analysis, build data analysis pipelines, and prepare data visualization to communicate results. However, R is not just a data analysis environment but a programming language. Advanced R programmers can develop complex packages and even improve R itself, but we do not cover advanced programming in this book. Nonetheless, in this section, we introduce three key programming concepts: conditional expressions, for-loops, and functions. These are not just key building blocks for advanced programming, but are sometimes useful during data analysis. We also note that there are several functions that are widely used to program in R but that we will not cover in this book. These include split, cut, do.call, and Reduce, as well as the data.table package. These are worth learning if you plan to become an expert R programmer.\nConditional expressions\rConditional expressions are one of the basic features of programming. They are used for what is called flow control. The most common conditional expression is the if-else statement. In R, we can actually perform quite a bit of data analysis without conditionals. However, they do come up occasionally, and you will need them once you start writing your own functions and packages.\nHere is a very simple example showing the general structure of an if-else statement. The basic idea is to print the reciprocal of a unless a is 0:\na \u0026lt;- 0\rif(a!=0){\rprint(1/a)\r} else{\rprint(\u0026quot;No reciprocal for 0.\u0026quot;)\r}\r## [1] \u0026quot;No reciprocal for 0.\u0026quot;\rLet’s look at one more example using the US murders data frame:\nlibrary(dslabs)\r## Warning: package \u0026#39;dslabs\u0026#39; was built under R version 4.2.3\rdata(murders)\rmurder_rate \u0026lt;- murders$total / murders$population*100000\rHere is a very simple example that tells us which states, if any, have a murder rate lower than 0.5 per 100,000. The if statement protects us from the case in which no state satisfies the condition.\nind \u0026lt;- which.min(murder_rate)\rif(murder_rate[ind] \u0026lt; 0.5){\rprint(murders$state[ind])\r} else{\rprint(\u0026quot;No state has murder rate that low\u0026quot;)\r}\r## [1] \u0026quot;Vermont\u0026quot;\rIf we try it again with a rate of 0.25, we get a different answer:\nif(murder_rate[ind] \u0026lt; 0.25){\rprint(murders$state[ind])\r} else{\rprint(\u0026quot;No state has a murder rate that low.\u0026quot;)\r}\r## [1] \u0026quot;No state has a murder rate that low.\u0026quot;\rA related function that is very useful is ifelse. This function takes three arguments: a logical and two possible answers. If the logical is TRUE, the value in the second argument is returned and if FALSE, the value in the third argument is returned. Here is an example:\na \u0026lt;- 0\rifelse(a \u0026gt; 0, 1/a, NA)\r## [1] NA\rThe function is particularly useful because it works on vectors. It examines each entry of the logical vector and returns elements from the vector provided in the second argument, if the entry is TRUE, or elements from the vector provided in the third argument, if the entry is FALSE.\na \u0026lt;- c(0, 1, 2, -4, 5)\rresult \u0026lt;- ifelse(a \u0026gt; 0, 1/a, NA)\rThis table helps us see what happened:\r\r\r\ra\r\ris_a_positive\r\ranswer1\r\ranswer2\r\rresult\r\r\r\r\r\r0\r\rFALSE\r\rInf\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r\r\r1\r\rTRUE\r\r1.00\r\rNA\r\r1.0\r\r\r\r2\r\rTRUE\r\r0.50\r\rNA\r\r0.5\r\r\r\r-4\r\rFALSE\r\r-0.25\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r\r\r5\r\rTRUE\r\r0.20\r\rNA\r\r0.2\r\r\r\r\rHere is an example of how this function can be readily used to replace all the missing values in a vector with zeros:\ndata(na_example)\rno_nas \u0026lt;- ifelse(is.na(na_example), 0, na_example)\rsum(is.na(no_nas))\r## [1] 0\rTwo other useful functions are any and all. The any function takes a vector of logicals and returns TRUE if any of the entries is TRUE. The all function takes a vector of logicals and returns TRUE if all of the entries are TRUE. Here is an example:\nz \u0026lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\rany(z)\r## [1] TRUE\rall(z)\r## [1] FALSE\r\rDefining functions\rAs you become more experienced, you will find yourself needing to perform the same operations over and over. A simple example is computing averages. We can compute the average of a vector x using the sum and length functions: sum(x)/length(x). Because we do this repeatedly, it is much more efficient to write a function that performs this operation. This particular operation is so common that someone already wrote the mean function and it is included in base R. However, you will encounter situations in which the function does not already exist, so R permits you to write your own. A simple version of a function that computes the average can be defined like this:\navg \u0026lt;- function(x){\rs \u0026lt;- sum(x)\rn \u0026lt;- length(x)\rs/n\r}\rNow avg is a function that computes the mean:\nx \u0026lt;- 1:100\ridentical(mean(x), avg(x))\r## [1] TRUE\rNotice that variables defined inside a function are not saved in the workspace. So while we use s and n when we call avg, the values are created and changed only during the call. Here is an illustrative example:\ns \u0026lt;- 3\ravg(1:10)\r## [1] 5.5\rs\r## [1] 3\rNote how s is still 3 after we call avg.\nIn general, functions are objects, so we assign them to variable names with \u0026lt;-. The function function tells R you are about to define a function. The general form of a function definition looks like this:\nmy_function \u0026lt;- function(VARIABLE_NAME){\rperform operations on VARIABLE_NAME and calculate VALUE\rVALUE\r}\rThe functions you define can have multiple arguments as well as default values. For example, we can define a function that computes either the arithmetic or geometric average depending on a user defined variable like this:\navg \u0026lt;- function(x, arithmetic = TRUE){\rn \u0026lt;- length(x)\rifelse(arithmetic, sum(x)/n, prod(x)^(1/n))\r}\rWe will learn more about how to create functions through experience as we face more complex tasks.\n\rNamespaces\rOnce you start becoming more of an R expert user, you will likely need to load several add-on packages for some of your analysis. Once you start doing this, it is likely that two packages use the same name for two different functions. And often these functions do completely different things. In fact, you have already encountered this because both dplyr and the R-base stats package define a filter function. There are five other examples in dplyr. We know this because when we first load dplyr we see the following message:\nThe following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:\rfilter, lag\rThe following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:\rintersect, setdiff, setequal, union\rSo what does R do when we type filter? Does it use the dplyr function or the stats function? From our previous work we know it uses the dplyr one. But what if we want to use the stats version?\nThese functions live in different namespaces. R will follow a certain order when searching for a function in these namespaces. You can see the order by typing:\nsearch()\rThe first entry in this list is the global environment which includes all the objects you define.\nSo what if we want to use the stats filter instead of the dplyr filter but dplyr appears first in the search list? You can force the use of a specific namespace by using double colons (::) like this:\nstats::filter\rIf we want to be absolutely sure that we use the dplyr filter, we can use\ndplyr::filter\rAlso note that if we want to use a function in a package without loading the entire package, we can use the double colon as well.\nFor more on this more advanced topic we recommend the R packages book1.\n\rFor-loops\rIf we had to write this section in a single sentence, it would be: Don’t use for-loops. Looping is intuitive, but R is designed to provide more computationally efficient solutions. For-loops should be considered a quick-and-dirty way to get an answer. But, hey, you live your own life. Below we provide a brief overview to for-looping.\nThe formula for the sum of the series \\(1+2+\\dots+n\\) is \\(n(n+1)/2\\). What if we weren’t sure that was the right function? How could we check? Using what we learned about functions we can create one that computes the \\(S_n\\):\ncompute_s_n \u0026lt;- function(n){\rx \u0026lt;- 1:n\rsum(x)\r}\rHow can we compute \\(S_n\\) for various values of \\(n\\), say \\(n=1,\\dots,25\\)? Do we write 25 lines of code calling compute_s_n? No, that is what for-loops are for in programming. In this case, we are performing exactly the same task over and over, and the only thing that is changing is the value of \\(n\\). For-loops let us define the range that our variable takes (in our example \\(n=1,\\dots,10\\)), then change the value and evaluate expression as you loop.\nPerhaps the simplest example of a for-loop is this useless piece of code:\nfor(i in 1:5){\rprint(i)\r}\r## [1] 1\r## [1] 2\r## [1] 3\r## [1] 4\r## [1] 5\rHere is the for-loop we would write for our \\(S_n\\) example:\nm \u0026lt;- 25\rs_n \u0026lt;- vector(length = m) # create an empty vector\rfor(n in 1:m){\rs_n[n] \u0026lt;- compute_s_n(n)\r}\rIn each iteration \\(n=1\\), \\(n=2\\), etc…, we compute \\(S_n\\) and store it in the \\(n\\)th entry of s_n.\nNow we can create a plot to search for a pattern:\nn \u0026lt;- 1:m\rplot(n, s_n)\rIf you noticed that it appears to be a quadratic, you are on the right track because the formula is \\(n(n+1)/2\\).\r--\n\rVectorization and functionals\rAlthough for-loops are an important concept to understand, in R we rarely use them. As you learn more R, you will realize that vectorization is preferred over for-loops since it results in shorter and clearer code. (It’s also vastly more efficient computationally, which can matter as your data grows.) A vectorized function is a function that will apply the same operation on each of the vectors.\nx \u0026lt;- 1:10\rsqrt(x)\r## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427\r## [9] 3.000000 3.162278\ry \u0026lt;- 1:10\rx*y\r## [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100\rTo make this calculation, there is no need for for-loops. However, not all functions work this way. For instance, the function we just wrote, compute_s_n, does not work element-wise since it is expecting a scalar. This piece of code does not run the function on each entry of n:\nn \u0026lt;- 1:25\rcompute_s_n(n)\rFunctionals are functions that help us apply the same function to each entry in a vector, matrix, data frame, or list. Here we cover the functional that operates on numeric, logical, and character vectors: sapply.\nThe function sapply permits us to perform element-wise operations on any function. Here is how it works:\nx \u0026lt;- 1:10\rsapply(x, sqrt)\r## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427\r## [9] 3.000000 3.162278\rEach element of x is passed on to the function sqrt and the result is returned. These results are concatenated. In this case, the result is a vector of the same length as the original x. This implies that the for-loop above can be written as follows:\nn \u0026lt;- 1:25\rs_n \u0026lt;- sapply(n, compute_s_n)\rOther functionals are apply, lapply, tapply, mapply, vapply, and replicate. We mostly use sapply, apply, and replicate in this book, but we recommend familiarizing yourselves with the others as they can be very useful.\n\rExercises\rThis is your first weekly lab assignment. Each lab assignment will need to be done in Rmarkdown using the lab template, just right-click and Save As…Start a new folder on your drive for this course, and inside that a new folder for lab assignments, and inside that a new folder for Lab No. 0. Rmarkdown will place some intermediate files in that folder, so leaving .Rmd files on your desktop will make things messy, fast.\nOnce you’ve saved the file, open it up in Rstudio.\n\rChange the title to “Lab 0”\n\rPut your name on it\n\rLeave the date alone. That little `r Sys.time(...)` will ask R to return the date (with M-D-Y formatting), which Rmarkdown will put in as if you had typed in the actual date. Note - if your system time is rendered in unicode characters (which may be the case in some languages), you will get an error. If this happens, you’ll have to manually change the date in the header along with your name.\n\rWhen you type ## 1. Text of..., Markdown will recognize “1. Text of” as a header and will automatically make it big.\n\rSo please copy the number and text of the question you are answering here.\r\rNext will be the ```{r q1} text that will be in gray. R will recognize this as code and will treat it as such. Anything run in that block will have an output.\n\rIf you want to see what the code will do, copy the code and paste it into the gray area. Then, click the green right arrow in the top-right corner of the gray code chunk. It should show you the results.\n\rUse the results (plus your understanding of the code) to answer the question\n\r\rWith each completed question, clidk the “Knit” button up above the script window. Rmarkdown will create a .pdf for you of your work (as long as it doesn’t hit any R errors). Knit often to make sure you haven’t hit an error!\n\rThe \\newpage line is a Latex command (the program that makes the typesetting look nice). It will start a new pdf page.\n\rOn the next page, copy question #2 to a new header using ##.\n\rOnce done, render one last .pdf, proofread it, and turn it in on D2L!\n\r\rFor more on using R Markdown, see the R Markdown page of our course resources.

Submit this to D2L by 11:59 PM on September 12th.\nNote: This lab has a few “try its” along the way. They are for your own practice and are not required. The lab consists of the three “exercises.”\n\rOur primary tool for data visualization in the course will be ggplot. Technically, we’re using ggplot2; the o.g. version lacked some of the modern features of its big brother. ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent and relatively straightforward system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places. Other languages provide more specific tools, but require you to learn a different tool for each application. In this class, we’ll dig into a single package for our visuals.\nUsing ggplot2\rIn order to get our hands dirty, we will first have to load ggplot2. To do this, and to access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this assignment, we will load the so-called tidyverse by running this code:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rIf you run this code and get an error message “there is no package called ‘tidyverse’”, you’ll need to first install it, then run library() once again. To install packages in R, we utilize the simple function install.packages(). In this case, we would write:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rOnce we’re up and running, we’re ready to dive into some basic exercises. ggplot2 works by specifying the connections between the variables in the data and the colors, points, and shapes you see on the screen. These logical connections are called aesthetic mappings or simply aesthetics.\nHow to use ggplot2 – the too-fast and wholly unclear recipe\r\rdata =: Define what your data is. For instance, below we’ll use the mpg data frame found in ggplot2 (by using ggplot2::mpg). As a reminder, a data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). This structure of data is often called a “table” but we’ll try to use terms slightly more precisely. The mpg data frame contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 different models of car.\n\rmapping = aes(...): How to map the variables in the data to aesthetics\n\rAxes, size of points, intensities of colors, which colors, shape of points, lines/points\r\rThen say what type of plot you want:\n\rboxplot, scatterplot, histogram, …\rthese are called ‘geoms’ in ggplot’s grammar, such as geom_point() giving scatter plots\r\r\rlibrary(ggplot2)\r... + geom_point() # Produces scatterplots\r... + geom_bar() # Bar plots\r.... + geom_boxplot() # boxplots\r... #\rYou link these steps by literally adding them together with + as we’ll see.\nTry it: (OPTIONAL) What other types of plots are there?

Before putting in this code yourself, try to intuit what might be going on.\nAny ideas?\nHere’s a breakdown of everything that happens after the p\u0026lt;- ggplot() call:\n\rdata = gapminder tells ggplot to use gapminder dataset, so if variable names are mentioned, they should be looked up in gapminder\rmapping = aes(...) shows that the mapping is a function call. There is a deeper logic to this that I will disucss below, but it’s easiest to simply accept that this is how you write it. Put another way, the mapping = aes(...) argument links variables to things you will see on the plot.\raes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp) maps the GDP data onto x, which is a known aesthetic (the x-coordinate) and life expectancy data onto y\r\rx and y are predefined names that are used by ggplot and friends\r\r\rExercise 1 of 3\nLet’s return to the mpg data. Among the variables in mpg are:\n\rdispl, a car’s engine size, in litres.\n\rhwy, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.\n\r\rGenerate a scatterplot between these two variables. Does it capture the intuitive relationship you expected? What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?\n\rIt turns out there’s a reason for doing all of this:\n\r“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”” — John Tukey\n\rIn the plot you made above, one group of points seems to fall outside of the linear trend. These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect. How can you explain these cars?\nLet’s hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the class value for each car. The class variable of the mpg dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).\nYou can add a third variable, like class, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an aesthetic. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe aesthetic properties. Thus, we are interested in exploring class as a level.\nYou can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, you can map the colors of your points to the class variable to reveal the class of each car. To map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside aes(). ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling. ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.\nExercise 2 of 3\nUsing your previous scatterplot of displ and hwy, map the colors of your points to the class variable to reveal the class of each car. What conclusions can we make?\n\rLet’s explore our previously saved p in greater detail. As with Exercise 1, we’ll add a layer. This says how some data gets turned into concrete visual aspects.\np + geom_point()\rp + geom_smooth()\rNote: Both of the above geom’s use the same mapping, where the x-axis represents gdpPercap and the y-axis represents lifeExp. You can find this yourself with some ease. But the first one maps the data to individual points, the other one maps it to a smooth line with error ranges.\nWe get a message that tells us that geom_smooth() is using the method = ‘gam’, so presumably we can use other methods. Let’s see if we can figure out which other methods there are.\n?geom_smooth\rp + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + geom_smooth(method = ...) + geom_smooth(method = ...)\rp + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + geom_smooth(method = ...) + geom_smooth(method = ..., color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)\rYou may start to see why ggplot2’s way of breaking up tasks is quite powerful: the geometric objects can all reuse the same mapping of data to aesthetics, yet the results are quite different. And if we want later geoms to use different mappings, then we can override them – but it isn’t necessary.\nConsider the output we’ve explored thus far. One potential issue lurking in the data is that most of it is bunched to the left. If we instead used a logarithmic scale, we should be able to spread the data out better.\np + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;) + scale_x_log10()\rTry it: (OPTIONAL) Describe what the scale_x_log10() does. Why is it a more evenly distributed cloud of points now? (2-3 sentences.)\nNice. We’re starting to get somewhere. But, you might notice that the x-axis now has scientific notation.

For convenience we will put the results of the first two steps in an object called p.\rTell ggplot how we want to see the relationships in our data.\rLayer on geoms as needed, by adding them on the p object one at a time.\rUse some additional functions to adjust scales, labels, tickmarks, titles.\r\r\re.g. scale_, labs(), and guides() functions\r\rAs you start to run more R code, you’re likely to run into problems. Don’t worry — it happens to everyone. I have been writing code in numerous languages for years, and every day I still write code that doesn’t work. Sadly, R is particularly persnickity, and its error messages are often opaque.\nStart by carefully comparing the code that you’re running to the code in these notes. R is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference. Make sure that every ( is matched with a ) and every ” is paired with another “. Sometimes you’ll run the code and nothing happens. Check the left-hand of your console: if it’s a +, it means that R doesn’t think you’ve typed a complete expression and it’s waiting for you to finish it. In this case, it’s usually easy to start from scratch again by pressing ESCAPE to abort processing the current command.\nOne common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the + in the wrong place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start.\nMapping Aesthetics vs Setting them\rp \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = gapminder,\rmapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = \u0026#39;yellow\u0026#39;))\rp + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\rThis is interesting (or annoying): the points are not yellow.

To do this, we will load the tidyverse by running this code:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\rBackground\rThe New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) maintains a list of construction sites that have been categorized as “essential” during the city’s shelter-in-place pandemic order. They’ve provided an interactive map here where you can see the different projects. There’s also a link there to download the complete dataset.\nFor this exercise, you’re going to use this data to visualize the amounts or proportions of different types of essential projects in the five boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island).\nAs you hopefully figured out by now, you’ll be doing all your R work in R Markdown. You can use an RStudio Project to keep your files well organized (either on your computer or on RStudio.cloud), but this is optional. If you decide to do so, either create a new project for this exercise only, or make a project for all your work in this class.\nYou’ll need to download one CSV file and put it somewhere on your computer (or upload it to RStudio.cloud if you’ve gone that direction)—preferably in a folder named data in your project folder. You can download the data from the DOB’s map, or use this link to get it directly:\n\r EssentialConstruction.csv\r\rR Markdown\rWriting regular text with R Markdown follows the rules of Markdown. You can make lists; different-size headers, etc. This should be relatively straightfoward. We talked about a few Markdown features like bold and italics in class. See this resource for more formatting.\nYou’ll also need to insert your own code chunks where needed. Rather than typing them by hand (that’s tedious and you might miscount the number of backticks!), use the “Insert” button at the top of the editing window, or type ctrl + alt + i on Windows, or ⌘ + ⌥ + i on macOS.\n\rData Prep\rOnce you download the EssentialConstruction.csv file and save it in your project folder, you can open it and start cleaning. I’ll help with that. I’ll give you a .Rmd that will get you started on the Exercises below. Download this and use it in place of your lab assignment template.\n\r 02-lab.Rmd\r\rExercise 1 of 1: Essential pandemic construction\nUsing the Lab 02 template above, do the following:\nA. Show the count or proportion of approved projects by borough using a bar chart. Make sure all the elements of your plot (axes, legend, etc.) are labeled.\nB. Show the count or proportion of approved projects by category using a lollipop chart. Not sure of what a lollipop chart is? Google R ggplot lollipop. A huge portion of knowing how to code is knowing how to google, find examples, and figure out where to put your variables from your data! Make sure all the elements of your plot (axes, legend, etc.) are labeled.\nYou don’t need to make these super fancy, but if you’re feeling brave, experiment with adding a labs() layer or changing fill colors with scale_fill_manual() or with palettes.\nBonus\nOverlay the data from Part 1 above onto a map of NYC.

Submit this to D2L by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on Monday, September 26th\n\rGetting started\rFor this exercise you’ll use state-level unemployment data from 2006 to 2016 that comes from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (if you’re curious, we describe how we built this dataset down below).\n\r unemployment.csv\r\rIn the end, to help you master file organization, we suggest that the structure of your project directory should look something like this:\nyour-project-name\\\r03-lab.Rmd\rdata\\\runemployment.csv\rThe example for this week will be incredibly helpful for this exercise. Reference it.\nFor this week, you need to start making your plots look nice. For full credit, you will have to label axes, label the plot, and experiment with themes. Experiment with adding a labs() layer or changing colors. Make sure all plots are legible and neat. If you’re super brave, try modifying a theme and its elements. Default plots will not receive full credit.\nEXERCISE 1\nUse data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to show the trends in employment rate for all 50 states plus DC between 2006 and 2016. Your first instinct might be to put all 50 lines on one graph. Even if using an aesthetic mapping for color, this will be a mess. Let’s give each state its own plot – use facet_grid or facet_wrap to do this. What stories does this plot tell? Which states struggled to recover from the 2008–09 recession?\nSome hints/tips:\n\rYou won’t need to filter out any missing rows because the data here is complete -— there are no state-year combinations with missing unemployment data.\n\rYou’ll be plotting 51 facets. You can filter out DC if you want to have a better grid (like 5 × 10).\n\rPlot the date column along the x-axis, not the year column. If you plot by year, you’ll get weird looking lines (try it for fun?), since these observations are monthly. If you really want to plot by year only, you’ll need to create a different data frame where you group by year and state and calculate the average unemployment rate for each year/state combination (i.e. group_by(year, state) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_unemployment = mean(unemployment)))\n\rTry mapping other aesthetics onto the graph too. You’ll notice there are columns for region and division—play with those as colors, for instance.\n\rThis plot might be big, so make sure you adjust fig.width and fig.height in the chunk options so that it’s visible when you knit it - try different values and knit to see how they look. If you’re unfamiliar with chunk options, see the Using R Markdown resources.\n\r\rEXERCISE 2\nUse data from the BLS to create a slopegraph that compares the unemployment rate in January 2006 with the unemployment rate in January 2009, either for all 50 states at once (good luck with that!) or for a specific region or division. Make sure the plot doesn’t look too busy or crowded in the end.\nWhat story does this plot tell? Which states in the US (or in the specific region you selected) were the most/least affected the Great Recession?\nSome hints/tips:\n\rYou should use filter() to only select rows where the year is 2006 or 2009 (i.e. filter(year %in% c(2006, 2009)) and to select rows where the month is January (filter(month == 1) or filter(month_name == \"January\"))\n\rIn order for the year to be plotted as separate categories on the x-axis, it needs to be a factor, so use mutate(year = factor(year)) to convert it.\n\rTo make ggplot draw lines between the 2006 and 2009 categories, you need to include group = state in the aesthetics.\n\r\r\rBonus Exercise\rThis is entirely optional but might be fun. Then again, it might not be fun. I don’t know.\nFor extra fun times, if you feel like it, create a bump chart showing something from the unemployment data (perhaps the top 10 states or bottom 10 states in unemployment?) Adapt the code in the example for today’s session.\nIf you do this, plotting 51 lines is going to be a huge mess. But filtering the data is also a bad idea, because states could drop in and out of the top/bottom 10 over time, and we don’t want to get rid of them. Instead, you can zoom in on a specific range of data in your plot with coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1, 10)), for instance.\n\rTurning everything in\rWhen you’re all done, click on the “Knit” button at the top of the editing window and create a PDF. Upload the PDF file to D2L.\n\rPostscript: how we got this unemployment data\rFor the curious, here’s the code we used to download the unemployment data from the BLS.\nAnd to pull the curtain back and show how much googling is involved in data visualization (and data analysis and programming in general), here was my process for getting this data:\nWe thought “We want to have students show variation in something domestic over time” and then we googled “us data by state”. Nothing really came up (since it was an exceedingly vague search in the first place), but some results mentioned unemployment rates, so we figured that could be cool.\n\rWe googled “unemployment statistics by state over time” and found that the BLS keeps statistics on this. We clicked on the “Data Tools” link in their main navigation bar, clicked on “Unemployment”, and then clicked on the “Multi-screen data search” button for the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS).\n\rWe walked through the multiple screens and got excited that we’d be able to download all unemployment stats for all states for a ton of years, but then the final page had links to 51 individual Excel files, which was dumb.\n\rSo we went back to Google and searched for “download bls data r” and found a few different packages people have written to do this. The first one we clicked on was blscrapeR at GitHub, and it looked like it had been updated recently, so we went with it.\n\rWe followed the examples in the blscrapeR package and downloaded data for every state.\n\r\rAnother day in the life of doing modern data science. This is an example of something you will be able to do by the end of this class. we had no idea people had written R packages to access BLS data, but there are (at least) 3 packages out there. After a few minutes of tinkering, we got it working and it is relatively straightforward.\n\r\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663755735,"objectID":"af0b365ca488e9ad2d9f06d6c238b02e","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/assignment/03-assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/03-assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Getting started\r\rBonus Exercise\rTurning everything in\rPostscript: how we got this unemployment data\r\r\r\rNOTE\nYou must turn in a PDF document of your R Markdown code.

This is useful for things as simple as making a \\(\\beta\\), or for writing out long, complex equations. In fact, Markdown does not like, and will error out on, “unicode” characters like the version of \\(\\beta\\) you get by using the text symbols. Needless to say, don’t do that – use LaTeX.\nIn LaTeX, there are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here, but the basic usage is easy.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n\r\r\r\rType…\r…to get\r\r\r\rBased on the DAG, the regression model for\restimating the effect of education on wages\ris $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or\r$\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$.\rBased on the DAG, the regression model for\restimating the effect of education on wages\ris \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or\r\\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).\r\r\r\rTo put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\r$$\rx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\r$$\rBut now we just use computers to solve for $x$.\r…to get…\n\rThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[\rx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\r\\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n\rBecause dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n\rSuperscripts and Subscripts\rSubscripts and superscripts are used often in this class. They are made by adding _{sub} or ^{super}. See the \\beta_0 in the table above, which made a nice \\(\\beta_{0}\\). If you have only one character or number, you don’t need to use the {}. That is beta_i,j will give \\(\\beta_i,j\\), and beta_{i,j} will give \\(\\beta_{i,j}\\).\n\rTables\rThere are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default\r------- ------ ---------- -------\r12 12 12 12\r123 123 123 123\r1 1 1 1\rTable: Caption goes here\r…to get…\n\rCaption goes here\r\rRight\rLeft\rCenter\rDefault\r\r\r\r12\r12\r12\r12\r\r123\r123\r123\r123\r\r1\r1\r1\r1\r\r\r\rFor pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center |\r|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|\r| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |\r| 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 |\r| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\rTable: Caption goes here\r…to get…\n\rCaption goes here\r\rRight\rLeft\rDefault\rCenter\r\r\r\r12\r12\r12\r12\r\r123\r123\r123\r123\r\r1\r1\r1\r1\r\r\r\r\rFootnotes\rThere are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags].\r[^1]: This is a note.\r[^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat.\rAnd here\u0026#39;s more of the document.\r…to get…\n\rHere is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n\r\rThis is a note.↩︎\r\r\rDAGs are neat.↩︎\r\r\r\r\rYou can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!]\r…to get…\n\rCausal inference is neat.1\n\r\rBut it can be hard too!↩︎\r\r\r\r\r\rFront matter\rYou can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n---\rtitle: Title of your document\rdate: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot;\r---\rYou can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot;\r---\rIf you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n---\rtitle: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39;\r---\r\rCitations\rSSC442 and EC420, you won’t use this part\nOne of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n---\rtitle: Title of your document\rdate: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot;\rbibliography: name_of_file.bib\r---\rChoose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n---\rtitle: Title of your document\rdate: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot;\rbibliography: name_of_file.bib\rcsl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot;\r---\rSome of the most common CSLs are:\n\rChicago author-date\rChicago note-bibliography\rChicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids)\rAPA 7th edition\rMLA 8th edition\r\rCite things in your document.

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nI have created a video walkthrough for using R Markdown for another course, but it is useful here. You can see it here ]\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms\r\rDocument: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n\rChunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r}\r# Code goes here\r```\rThere must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n\rKnit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected). We will always use PDF for this course.\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n\r\r\rAdd chunks\rThere are three ways to insert chunks:\n\rPress ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n\rClick on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n\rManually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n\r\r\rChunk names\rYou can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk}\r# Code goes here\r```\r\rChunk options\rThere are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\r# Code goes here\r```\rThe most common chunk options are these:\n\rfig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures\recho=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are\rmessage=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted\rwarning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted\rinclude=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document. Don’t use this on your labs as we need to see your work, but do use this for your final project when the output is to be polished and clean.\r\rYou can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\nChunk fig.width and fig.height\rWhen a code chunk includes a plot (like from ggplot), the “canvas” size used can affect the output. You may have noticed if you plot directly in Rstudio, the plot resizes when you change the pane size. Each chunk has its own canvas size, and you can change that. So, if you have a chunk with a large plot, you can change the fig.width=7.5 in the chunk options. Note that units default to inches, so no more than 7.5 will fit on a regular-sized sheet of paper (or appropriately sized PDF).\n\r\rInline chunks\rYou can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE}\ravg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg)\r```\rThe average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon.\r… would knit into this:\n\rThe average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n\r\rOutput formats\rYou can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot;\routput:\rhtml_document: default\rpdf_document: default\rword_document: default\rYou can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot;\rdate: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot;\routput: html_document: toc: yes\rfig_caption: yes\rfig_height: 8\rfig_width: 10\rpdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine\rtoc: yes\rword_document: toc: yes\rfig_caption: yes\rfig_height: 4\rfig_width: 5\r---\r\r","date":1578873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663755735,"objectID":"00c0b36df90b91640842af65d1311657","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/resource/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/rmarkdown/","section":"resource","summary":"Key terms\rAdd chunks\rChunk names\rChunk options\r\rChunk fig.width and fig.height\r\rInline chunks\rOutput formats\r\r\rR Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\rfilter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\rfilter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; )\rBut you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n\rMain style things to pay attention to for this class\r\rImportant note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n\rSpacing\r\rSee the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\rPut spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10)\r# Bad\rfilter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10)\rfilter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10)\rfilter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10)\rPut spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10)\r# Bad\rfilter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10)\rfilter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10)\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10)\rDon’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10)\r# Bad\rfilter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10)\rfilter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10)\rfilter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )\r\rLong lines\r\rSee the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\rIt’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\r# Good\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\r# Good\rfilter(mpg,\rcty \u0026gt; 10,\rclass == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;)\r# Bad\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))\r# Good\rfilter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))\r\rPipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+)\rPut each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good\rggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\rgeom_point() +\rgeom_smooth() +\rtheme_bw()\r# Bad\rggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\rgeom_point() + geom_smooth() +\rtheme_bw()\r# Super bad\rggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()\r# Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work\rggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))\r+ geom_point()\r+ geom_smooth() + theme_bw()\rPut each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\r# Bad\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\r# Super bad\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\r# Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work\rmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10)\r%\u0026gt;% group_by(class)\r%\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\r\rComments\r\rSee the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\rComments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good\r#Bad\r#Bad\rIf the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 +\rgroup_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups\rsummarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group\rYou can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 +\rgroup_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups\rsummarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group\rIf the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines.

Tell us your team name (be creative), and list in the email the names of all of the team members and their email address (in addition to cc-ing those team members on the email).\nIf you opt to not form a team, you will be automatically added to the “willing to be randomly assigned” pool and will be paired with another 1-2 persons.\nSend this email by September 21st and we will assign un-teamed folks at the beginning of the following week.

It is also quite important.\nWe want to discuss why we eventually will need to utilize tons of difficult mathematics. Why do we care so much about hypothesis tests and the like?\nMoreover, we can highlight why we want our data structured to behave nicely.\nLearning From Data\rThe following are the baisc requirements for statistical learning\nA pattern exists\n\rThis pattern is not easily expressed in a closed mathematical form\n\rYou have data\n\r\r\rFormalization\rWe think of our outcome-of-interest as a reponse or target that we wish to predict or wish to learn something about.\nWe generically refer to the response as \\(Y\\)\nOther aspects of the data are known as features, inputs, predictors, or regressors. We call one of these \\(X_i\\).\n\rThe subscript \\(i\\) indicates that we have an \\(X\\) realized for every individual observation in our data\r\rWe can refer to the input vector collectively as:\n\\[X = \\begin{bmatrix}\rx_{11} \u0026amp; x_{12} \\\\\rx_{21} \u0026amp; x_{22} \\\\\r\\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\\rx_{N1} \u0026amp; x_{N2}\r\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThis is sometimes called a “rectangular array” of data. Sounds complicated, but you’ve definitely encountered it before. Excel holds “rectangular arrays” of data.\nWe are seeking some unknown function that maps \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\)\nPut another way, we are seeking to explain \\(Y\\) as follows:\n\\[Y = f(X) + e\\]\n\rThe Target Function\rWe call the function \\(f: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}\\) the target function\nHow do we find the function? We don’t! We get as close as we can, though:\n\rObserve data \\((\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \\cdots, (\\mathbf{x}_N, y_N)\\)\n\rUse some algorithm to approximate \\(f\\)\n\rProduce final hypothesis function \\(g \\approx f\\)\n\rEvaluate how well \\(g\\) approximates \\(f\\) and iterate as needed.\n\r\r\rWhy Estimate an Unknown Function?\rWith a good estimate of \\(f\\) we can make predictions of \\(Y\\) at new points \\(X = x\\)\nWe can also understand which components of \\(X = (X_1, X_2, \\cdots, X_m)\\) are important in explaining \\(Y\\), and which are (potentially) irrelevant\n\re.g. GDP and yearsindustrialized have a big impact on emissions but hydroutilization typically does not.\r\rDepending on the complexity of \\(f\\), we may be able to meaningfully understand how each component of \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\).\n(But we should be careful about assigning causal interpretations, more on this later)\n\rThe Parable of the Marbles\r(Courtesy of Prof. Bushong)\nImagine a bag of marbles with two types of marbles: ♣️ and ♦️.\nWe are going to pick a sample of \\(n\\) marbles (with replacement).\nWe want to learn something about \\(\\mu\\), the objective probability to pick a ♣️.\nIn addition to defining the objective probability of picking a ♣️, we have an observed fraction \\(\\eta\\), which will define as the fraction of ♣️ in the sample.\nQuestion: Can we say anything exact and for-sure about \\(\\mu\\) (outside the data) after observing \\(\\eta\\) (the data)?\n\rNo. It is possible for the sample to be all ♣️, ♣️, ♣️, ♣️, ♣️ even when the bag is is 50/50 ♦️\n\rNo matter what we draw, we can’t (based on that draw alone) eliminate the possibility of drawing a ♦️.\n\rAnd unless we assume that the only two values in the world are ♦️ and ♣️, we can’t rule out 💩1\n\r\r\rQuestion: If we really can’t say anything exact and for-sure, then why do we do things like polling (e.g. to predict the outcome of a presidential election)?\n\rThe bad case, that we draw something that has is completely misleading, is possible but not probable.\r\r\rOutside the Data\rPut another way, since \\(f\\) is unknown, it can take on any value outside the data we have, no matter how large the data.\n\rThis is called No Free Lunch\r\rYou cannot know anything for sure about \\(f\\) outside the data without making assumptions.\nIs there any hope to know anything about \\(f\\) outside the data set without making assumptions about \\(f\\)?\nYes, if we are willing to give up the “for sure”.\nInstead of\n\\[\rY = f(X)\r\\]\nwe can work with\n\\[\rY = f(X) + e\r\\]\nand if we guess at an \\(f\\) function that gets pretty close, \\(e\\) will be pretty small. If \\(e\\) is pretty small, then we’re in good shape for prediction!\n\rHoeffding’s Inequality\rHoeffding’s Inequality states, loosely, that \\(\\eta\\) (the fraction of our sample that is ♣️) cannot be too far from \\(\\mu\\).\n\\[\\mathbb{P}\\left[|\\eta - \\mu| \u0026gt; \\epsilon \\right] \\leq 2e^{-2\\epsilon^2n}\\]\r\\(\\eta \\approx \\mu\\) is called probably approximately correct (PAC) learning.\n\rAn example of Hoeffding’s Inequality\rExample: n = 1,000. Draw a sample and observe \\(\\eta\\)\n\r\\(\\sim\\) 99% of the time, \\(\\mu - .05 \\leq \\eta \\leq \\mu+.05\\)\n\rThis is implied by setting \\(\\epsilon = 0.05\\) and using \\(n=1,000\\)\r\r99.9999996% of the time \\(\\mu - .10 \\leq \\eta \\leq \\mu + .10\\)\n\r\rWhat does this mean?\nIf I repeatedly pick a sample of size 1,000, observe \\(\\eta\\) and claim that \\(\\mu \\in \\left[\\eta - .05, \\eta + .05\\right]\\) (or that the error bar is \\(\\pm 0.05\\)), I will be right 99% of the time.\nOn any particular sample you may be wrong, but not often.\nNOTE\nThis week’s content is split into two “halves”: the critical data manipulation information contained below and a more-entertaining discussion of visualization included in the Exercises. This is a pretty big shift in gears, so here’s a picture of my dog:\n\r\r\rThe tidyverse\rIn last week’s content and lab, we demonstrated how to manipulate vectors by reordering and subsetting them through indexing. However, once we start more advanced analyses, the preferred unit for data storage is not the vector but the data frame. In this lecture, we learn to work directly with data frames, which greatly facilitate the organization of information. We will be using data frames for the majority of this class and you will use them for the majority of your data science life (however long that might be). We will focus on a specific data format referred to as tidy and on specific collection of packages that are particularly helpful for working with tidy data referred to as the tidyverse.\nWe can load all the tidyverse packages at once by installing and loading the tidyverse package:2\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rWe will learn how to implement the tidyverse approach throughout the book, but before delving into the details, in this chapter we introduce some of the most widely used tidyverse functionality, starting with the dplyr package for manipulating data frames and the purrr package for working with functions. Note that the tidyverse also includes a graphing package, ggplot2, the readr package, and many others. In this lesson, we first introduce the concept of tidy data and then demonstrate how we use the tidyverse to work with data frames in this format.\nTidy data\r\rWe say that a data table is in tidy format if each row represents one observation and columns represent the different variables available for each of these observations. The murders dataset is an example of a tidy data frame.\n\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rhead(murders)\r## state abb region population total\r## 1 Alabama AL South 4779736 135\r## 2 Alaska AK West 710231 19\r## 3 Arizona AZ West 6392017 232\r## 4 Arkansas AR South 2915918 93\r## 5 California CA West 37253956 1257\r## 6 Colorado CO West 5029196 65\rEach row represent a state with each of the five columns providing a different variable related to these states: name, abbreviation, region, population, and total murders.\nTo see how the same information can be provided in different formats, consider the following example:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(\u0026quot;gapminder\u0026quot;) # gapminder will now be a data.frame in your \u0026quot;environment\u0026quot; (memory)\rtidy_data \u0026lt;- gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(country %in% c(\u0026quot;South Korea\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Germany\u0026quot;) \u0026amp; !is.na(fertility)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(country, year, fertility)\rhead(tidy_data, 6)\r## country year fertility\r## 1 Germany 1960 2.41\r## 2 South Korea 1960 6.16\r## 3 Germany 1961 2.44\r## 4 South Korea 1961 5.99\r## 5 Germany 1962 2.47\r## 6 South Korea 1962 5.79\rThis tidy dataset provides fertility rates for two countries across the years. This is a tidy dataset because each row presents one observation with the three variables being country, year, and fertility rate. However, this dataset originally came in another format and was reshaped for the dslabs package. Originally, the data was in the following format:\n## country 1960 1961 1962\r## 1 Germany 2.41 2.44 2.47\r## 2 South Korea 6.16 5.99 5.79\rThe same information is provided, but there are two important differences in the format: 1) each row includes several observations and 2) one of the variables’ values, year, is stored in the header. For the tidyverse packages to be optimally used, data need to be reshaped into tidy format, which you will learn to do throughout this course. For starters, though, we will use example datasets that are already in tidy format.\nAlthough not immediately obvious, as you go through the book you will start to appreciate the advantages of working in a framework in which functions use tidy formats for both inputs and outputs. You will see how this permits the data analyst to focus on more important aspects of the analysis rather than the format of the data.\nTRY IT\nExamine the built-in dataset co2. Which of the following is true:\r\rco2 is tidy data: it has one year for each row.\rco2 is not tidy: we need at least one column with a character vector.\rco2 is not tidy: it is a matrix instead of a data frame.\rco2 is not tidy: to be tidy we would have to wrangle it to have three columns (year, month and value), then each co2 observation would have a row.\r\rExamine the built-in dataset ChickWeight. Which of the following is true:\r\rChickWeight is not tidy: each chick has more than one row.\rChickWeight is tidy: each observation (a weight) is represented by one row. The chick from which this measurement came is one of the variables.\rChickWeight is not tidy: we are missing the year column.\rChickWeight is tidy: it is stored in a data frame.\r\rExamine the built-in dataset BOD. Which of the following is true:\r\rBOD is not tidy: it only has six rows.\rBOD is not tidy: the first column is just an index.\rBOD is tidy: each row is an observation with two values (time and demand)\rBOD is tidy: all small datasets are tidy by definition.\r\rWhich of the following built-in datasets is tidy (you can pick more than one):\r\rBJsales\rEuStockMarkets\rDNase\rFormaldehyde\rOrange\rUCBAdmissions\r\r\r\rManipulating data frames\rThe dplyr package from the tidyverse introduces functions that perform some of the most common operations when working with data frames and uses names for these functions that are relatively easy to remember. For instance, to change the data table by adding a new column, we use mutate. To filter the data table to a subset of rows, we use filter. Finally, to subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use select.\nAdding a column with mutate\rWe want all the necessary information for our analysis to be included in the data table. So the first task is to add the murder rates to our murders data frame. The function mutate takes the data frame as a first argument and the name and values of the variable as a second argument using the convention name = values. So, to add murder rates, we use:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(\u0026quot;murders\u0026quot;)\rmurders \u0026lt;- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)\rNotice that here we used total and population inside the function, which are objects that are not defined in our workspace. But why don’t we get an error?\nThis is one of dplyr’s main features. Functions in this package, such as mutate, know to look for variables in the data frame provided in the first argument. In the call to mutate above, total will have the values in murders$total. This approach makes the code much more readable.\nWe can see that the new column is added:\nhead(murders)\r## state abb region population total rate\r## 1 Alabama AL South 4779736 135 2.824424\r## 2 Alaska AK West 710231 19 2.675186\r## 3 Arizona AZ West 6392017 232 3.629527\r## 4 Arkansas AR South 2915918 93 3.189390\r## 5 California CA West 37253956 1257 3.374138\r## 6 Colorado CO West 5029196 65 1.292453\rNote: Although we have overwritten the original murders object, this does not change the object that loaded with data(murders). If we load the murders data again, the original will overwrite our mutated version.\n\rSubsetting with filter\rNow suppose that we want to filter the data table to only show the entries for which the murder rate is lower than 0.71. To do this we use the filter function, which takes the data table as the first argument and then the conditional statement as the second. Like mutate, we can use the unquoted variable names from murders inside the function and it will know we mean the columns and not objects in the workspace.\nfilter(murders, rate \u0026lt;= 0.71)\r## state abb region population total rate\r## 1 Hawaii HI West 1360301 7 0.5145920\r## 2 Iowa IA North Central 3046355 21 0.6893484\r## 3 New Hampshire NH Northeast 1316470 5 0.3798036\r## 4 North Dakota ND North Central 672591 4 0.5947151\r## 5 Vermont VT Northeast 625741 2 0.3196211\r\rSelecting columns with select\rAlthough our data table only has six columns, some data tables include hundreds. If we want to view just a few, we can use the dplyr select function. In the code below we select three columns, assign this to a new object and then filter the new object:\nnew_table \u0026lt;- select(murders, state, region, rate)\rfilter(new_table, rate \u0026lt;= 0.71)\r## state region rate\r## 1 Hawaii West 0.5145920\r## 2 Iowa North Central 0.6893484\r## 3 New Hampshire Northeast 0.3798036\r## 4 North Dakota North Central 0.5947151\r## 5 Vermont Northeast 0.3196211\rIn the call to select, the first argument murders is an object, but state, region, and rate are variable names.\nTRY IT\nLoad the dplyr package and the murders dataset.\r\rlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(murders)\rYou can add columns using the dplyr function mutate. This function is aware of the column names and inside the function you can call them unquoted:\nmurders \u0026lt;- mutate(murders, population_in_millions = population / 10^6)\rWe can write population rather than murders$population because mutate is part of dplyr. The function mutate knows we are grabbing columns from murders.\nUse the function mutate to add a murders column named rate with the per 100,000 murder rate as in the example code above. Make sure you redefine murders as done in the example code above ( murders \u0026lt;- [your code]) so we can keep using this variable.\nIf rank(x) gives you the ranks of x from lowest to highest, rank(-x) gives you the ranks from highest to lowest. Use the function mutate to add a column rank containing the rank, from highest to lowest murder rate. Make sure you redefine murders so we can keep using this variable.\n\rWith dplyr, we can use select to show only certain columns. For example, with this code we would only show the states and population sizes:\n\r\rselect(murders, state, population) %\u0026gt;% head()\rUse select to show the state names and abbreviations in murders. Do not redefine murders, just show the results.\nThe dplyr function filter is used to choose specific rows of the data frame to keep. Unlike select which is for columns, filter is for rows. For example, you can show just the New York row like this:\r\rfilter(murders, state == \u0026quot;New York\u0026quot;)\rYou can use other logical vectors to filter rows.\nUse filter to show the top 5 states with the highest murder rates. After we add murder rate and rank, do not change the murders dataset, just show the result. Remember that you can filter based on the rank column.\nWe can remove rows using the != operator. For example, to remove Florida, we would do this:\r\rno_florida \u0026lt;- filter(murders, state != \u0026quot;Florida\u0026quot;)\rCreate a new data frame called no_south that removes states from the South region. How many states are in this category? You can use the function nrow for this.\nWe can also use %in% to filter with dplyr. You can therefore see the data from New York and Texas like this:\r\rfilter(murders, state %in% c(\u0026quot;New York\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Texas\u0026quot;))\rCreate a new data frame called murders_nw with only the states from the Northeast and the West. How many states are in this category?\nSuppose you want to live in the Northeast or West and want the murder rate to be less than 1. We want to see the data for the states satisfying these options. Note that you can use logical operators with filter. Here is an example in which we filter to keep only small states in the Northeast region.\r\rfilter(murders, population \u0026lt; 5000000 \u0026amp; region == \u0026quot;Northeast\u0026quot;)\rMake sure murders has been defined with rate and rank and still has all states. Create a table called my_states that contains rows for states satisfying both the conditions: it is in the Northeast or West and the murder rate is less than 1. Use select to show only the state name, the rate, and the rank.\n\r\r\rThe pipe: %\u0026gt;%\rWith dplyr we can perform a series of operations, for example select and then filter, by sending the results of one function to another using what is called the pipe operator: %\u0026gt;%. Some details are included below.\nWe wrote code above to show three variables (state, region, rate) for states that have murder rates below 0.71. To do this, we defined the intermediate object new_table. In dplyr we can write code that looks more like a description of what we want to do without intermediate objects:\n\\[ \\mbox{original data }\r\\rightarrow \\mbox{ select }\r\\rightarrow \\mbox{ filter } \\]\nFor such an operation, we can use the pipe %\u0026gt;%. The code looks like this:\nmurders %\u0026gt;% select(state, region, rate) %\u0026gt;% filter(rate \u0026lt;= 0.71)\r## state region rate\r## 1 Hawaii West 0.5145920\r## 2 Iowa North Central 0.6893484\r## 3 New Hampshire Northeast 0.3798036\r## 4 North Dakota North Central 0.5947151\r## 5 Vermont Northeast 0.3196211\rThis line of code is equivalent to the two lines of code above. What is going on here?\nIn general, the pipe sends the result of the left side of the pipe to be the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe. Here is a very simple example:\n16 %\u0026gt;% sqrt()\r## [1] 4\rWe can continue to pipe values along:\n16 %\u0026gt;% sqrt() %\u0026gt;% log2()\r## [1] 2\rThe above statement is equivalent to log2(sqrt(16)).\nRemember that the pipe sends values to the first argument, so we can define other arguments as if the first argument is already defined:\n16 %\u0026gt;% sqrt() %\u0026gt;% log(base = 2)\r## [1] 2\rTherefore, when using the pipe with data frames and dplyr, we no longer need to specify the required first argument since the dplyr functions we have described all take the data as the first argument. In the code we wrote:\nmurders %\u0026gt;% select(state, region, rate) %\u0026gt;% filter(rate \u0026lt;= 0.71)\rmurders is the first argument of the select function, and the new data frame (formerly new_table) is the first argument of the filter function.\nNote that the pipe works well with functions where the first argument is the input data. Functions in tidyverse packages like dplyr have this format and can be used easily with the pipe. It’s worth noting that as of R 4.1, there is a base-R version of the pipe |\u0026gt;, though this has its disadvantages. We’ll stick with %\u0026gt;% for now.\nTRY IT\nThe pipe %\u0026gt;% can be used to perform operations sequentially without having to define intermediate objects. Start by redefining murder to include rate and rank.\r\rmurders \u0026lt;- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000,\rrank = rank(-rate))\rIn the solution to the previous exercise, we did the following:\nmy_states \u0026lt;- filter(murders, region %in% c(\u0026quot;Northeast\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;West\u0026quot;) \u0026amp;\rrate \u0026lt; 1)\rselect(my_states, state, rate, rank)\rThe pipe %\u0026gt;% permits us to perform both operations sequentially without having to define an intermediate variable my_states. We therefore could have mutated and selected in the same line like this:\nmutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000,\rrank = rank(-rate)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(state, rate, rank)\rNotice that select no longer has a data frame as the first argument. The first argument is assumed to be the result of the operation conducted right before the %\u0026gt;%.\nRepeat the previous exercise, but now instead of creating a new object, show the result and only include the state, rate, and rank columns. Use a pipe %\u0026gt;% to do this in just one line.\nReset murders to the original table by using data(murders). Use a pipe to create a new data frame called my_states that considers only states in the Northeast or West which have a murder rate lower than 1, and contains only the state, rate and rank columns. The pipe should also have four components separated by three %\u0026gt;%. The code should look something like this:\r\rmy_states \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;%\rmutate SOMETHING %\u0026gt;%\rfilter SOMETHING %\u0026gt;%\rselect SOMETHING\r\r\rSummarizing data\rAn important part of exploratory data analysis is summarizing data. The average and standard deviation are two examples of widely used summary statistics. More informative summaries can often be achieved by first splitting data into groups. In this section, we cover two new dplyr verbs that make these computations easier: summarize and group_by. We learn to access resulting values using the pull function.\nsummarize\rThe summarize function in dplyr provides a way to compute summary statistics with intuitive and readable code. We start with a simple example based on heights. The heights dataset includes heights and sex reported by students in an in-class survey.\nlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(heights)\rhead(heights)\r## sex height\r## 1 Male 75\r## 2 Male 70\r## 3 Male 68\r## 4 Male 74\r## 5 Male 61\r## 6 Female 65\rThe following code computes the average and standard deviation for females:\ns \u0026lt;- heights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))\rs\r## average standard_deviation\r## 1 64.93942 3.760656\rThis takes our original data table as input, filters it to keep only females, and then produces a new summarized table with just the average and the standard deviation of heights. We get to choose the names of the columns of the resulting table. For example, above we decided to use average and standard_deviation, but we could have used other names just the same.\nBecause the resulting table stored in s is a data frame, we can access the components with the accessor $:\ns$average\r## [1] 64.93942\rs$standard_deviation\r## [1] 3.760656\rAs with most other dplyr functions, summarize is aware of the variable names and we can use them directly. So when inside the call to the summarize function we write mean(height), the function is accessing the column with the name “height” and then computing the average of the resulting numeric vector. We can compute any other summary that operates on vectors and returns a single value. For example, we can add the median, minimum, and maximum heights like this:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(median = median(height), minimum = min(height),\rmaximum = max(height))\r## median minimum maximum\r## 1 64.98031 51 79\rWe can obtain these three values with just one line using the quantile function: for example, quantile(x, c(0,0.5,1)) returns the min (0th percentile), median (50th percentile), and max (100th percentile) of the vector x. However, if we attempt to use a function like this that returns two or more values inside summarize:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))\rwe will receive an error: Error: expecting result of length one, got : 2. With the function summarize, we can only call functions that return a single value. In later sections, we will learn how to deal with functions that return more than one value.\nFor another example of how we can use the summarize function, let’s compute the average murder rate for the United States. Remember our data table includes total murders and population size for each state and we have already used dplyr to add a murder rate column:\nmurders \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;% mutate(rate = total/population*100000)\rRemember that the US murder rate is not the average of the state murder rates:\nsummarize(murders, mean(rate))\r## mean(rate)\r## 1 2.779125\rThis is because in the computation above the small states are given the same weight as the large ones. The US murder rate is the total number of murders in the US divided by the total US population. So the correct computation is:\nus_murder_rate \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000)\rus_murder_rate\r## rate\r## 1 3.034555\rThis computation counts larger states proportionally to their size which results in a larger value.\n\rpull\rThe us_murder_rate object defined above represents just one number. Yet we are storing it in a data frame:\nclass(us_murder_rate)\r## [1] \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\rsince, as most dplyr functions, summarize always returns a data frame.\nThis might be problematic if we want to use this result with functions that require a numeric value. Here we show a useful trick for accessing values stored in data when using pipes: when a data object is piped that object and its columns can be accessed using the pull function. To understand what we mean take a look at this line of code:\nus_murder_rate %\u0026gt;% pull(rate)\r## [1] 3.034555\rThis returns the value in the rate column of us_murder_rate making it equivalent to us_murder_rate$rate.\nTo get a number from the original data table with one line of code we can type:\nus_murder_rate \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000) %\u0026gt;%\rpull(rate)\rus_murder_rate\r## [1] 3.034555\rwhich is now a numeric:\nclass(us_murder_rate)\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\r\rGroup then summarize with group_by\rA common operation in data exploration is to first split data into groups and then compute summaries for each group. For example, we may want to compute the average and standard deviation for men’s and women’s heights separately. The group_by function helps us do this.\nIf we type this:\nheights %\u0026gt;% group_by(sex)\r## # A tibble: 1,050 × 2\r## # Groups: sex [2]\r## sex height\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Male 75\r## 2 Male 70\r## 3 Male 68\r## 4 Male 74\r## 5 Male 61\r## 6 Female 65\r## 7 Female 66\r## 8 Female 62\r## 9 Female 66\r## 10 Male 67\r## # ℹ 1,040 more rows\rThe result does not look very different from heights, except we see Groups: sex [2] when we print the object. Although not immediately obvious from its appearance, this is now a special data frame called a grouped data frame, and dplyr functions, in particular summarize, will behave differently when acting on this object. Conceptually, you can think of this table as many tables, with the same columns but not necessarily the same number of rows, stacked together in one object. When we summarize the data after grouping, this is what happens:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(sex) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))\r## # A tibble: 2 × 3\r## sex average standard_deviation\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Female 64.9 3.76\r## 2 Male 69.3 3.61\rThe summarize function applies the summarization to each group separately.\nFor another example, let’s compute the median murder rate in the four regions of the country:\nmurders %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(region) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(median_rate = median(rate))\r## # A tibble: 4 × 2\r## region median_rate\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Northeast 1.80\r## 2 South 3.40\r## 3 North Central 1.97\r## 4 West 1.29\r\r\rSorting data frames\rWhen examining a dataset, it is often convenient to sort the table by the different columns. We know about the order and sort function, but for ordering entire tables, the dplyr function arrange is useful. For example, here we order the states by population size:\nmurders %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(population) %\u0026gt;%\rhead()\r## state abb region population total rate\r## 1 Wyoming WY West 563626 5 0.8871131\r## 2 District of Columbia DC South 601723 99 16.4527532\r## 3 Vermont VT Northeast 625741 2 0.3196211\r## 4 North Dakota ND North Central 672591 4 0.5947151\r## 5 Alaska AK West 710231 19 2.6751860\r## 6 South Dakota SD North Central 814180 8 0.9825837\rWith arrange we get to decide which column to sort by. To see the states by murder rate, from lowest to highest, we arrange by rate instead:\nmurders %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(rate) %\u0026gt;%\rhead()\r## state abb region population total rate\r## 1 Vermont VT Northeast 625741 2 0.3196211\r## 2 New Hampshire NH Northeast 1316470 5 0.3798036\r## 3 Hawaii HI West 1360301 7 0.5145920\r## 4 North Dakota ND North Central 672591 4 0.5947151\r## 5 Iowa IA North Central 3046355 21 0.6893484\r## 6 Idaho ID West 1567582 12 0.7655102\rNote that the default behavior is to order in ascending order. In dplyr, the function desc transforms a vector so that it is in descending order. To sort the table in descending order, we can type:\nmurders %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(desc(rate))\rNested sorting\rIf we are ordering by a column with ties, we can use a second column to break the tie. Similarly, a third column can be used to break ties between first and second and so on. Here we order by region, then within region we order by murder rate:\nmurders %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(region, rate) %\u0026gt;%\rhead()\r## state abb region population total rate\r## 1 Vermont VT Northeast 625741 2 0.3196211\r## 2 New Hampshire NH Northeast 1316470 5 0.3798036\r## 3 Maine ME Northeast 1328361 11 0.8280881\r## 4 Rhode Island RI Northeast 1052567 16 1.5200933\r## 5 Massachusetts MA Northeast 6547629 118 1.8021791\r## 6 New York NY Northeast 19378102 517 2.6679599\r\rThe top \\(n\\)\rIn the code above, we have used the function head to avoid having the page fill up with the entire dataset. If we want to see a larger proportion, we can use the top_n function. This function takes a data frame as it’s first argument, the number of rows to show in the second, and the variable to filter by in the third. Here is an example of how to see the top 5 rows:\nmurders %\u0026gt;% top_n(5, rate)\r## state abb region population total rate\r## 1 District of Columbia DC South 601723 99 16.452753\r## 2 Louisiana LA South 4533372 351 7.742581\r## 3 Maryland MD South 5773552 293 5.074866\r## 4 Missouri MO North Central 5988927 321 5.359892\r## 5 South Carolina SC South 4625364 207 4.475323\rNote that rows are not sorted by rate, only filtered. If we want to sort, we need to use arrange.\rNote that if the third argument is left blank, top_n filters by the last column.\nTRY IT\nFor these exercises, we will be using the data from the survey collected by the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This center has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the 1960’s. Starting in 1999, about 5,000 individuals of all ages have been interviewed every year and they complete the health examination component of the survey. Part of the data is made available via the NHANES package. Once you install the NHANES package, you can load the data like this:\nlibrary(NHANES)\r## Warning: package \u0026#39;NHANES\u0026#39; was built under R version 4.2.3\rdata(NHANES)\rThe NHANES data has many missing values. The mean and sd functions in R will return NA if any of the entries of the input vector is an NA. Here is an example:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(na_example)\rmean(na_example)\r## [1] NA\rsd(na_example)\r## [1] NA\rTo ignore the NAs we can use the na.rm argument:\nmean(na_example, na.rm = TRUE)\r## [1] 2.301754\rsd(na_example, na.rm = TRUE)\r## [1] 1.22338\rLet’s now explore the NHANES data.\nWe will provide some basic facts about blood pressure. First let’s select a group to set the standard. We will use 20-to-29-year-old females. AgeDecade is a categorical variable with these ages. Note that the category is coded like ” 20-29”, with a space in front! What is the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure as saved in the BPSysAve variable? Save it to a variable called ref.\r\rHint: Use filter and summarize and use the na.rm = TRUE argument when computing the average and standard deviation. You can also filter the NA values using filter.\nUsing a pipe, assign the average to a numeric variable ref_avg. Hint: Use the code similar to above and then pull.\n\rNow report the min and max values for the same group.\n\rCompute the average and standard deviation for females, but for each age group separately rather than a selected decade as in question 1. Note that the age groups are defined by AgeDecade. Hint: rather than filtering by age and gender, filter by Gender and then use group_by.\n\rRepeat exercise 4 for males.\n\rWe can actually combine both summaries for exercises 4 and 5 into one line of code. This is because group_by permits us to group by more than one variable. Obtain one big summary table using group_by(AgeDecade, Gender).\n\rFor males between the ages of 40-49, compare systolic blood pressure across race as reported in the Race1 variable. Order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.\n\r\r\r\r\rTibbles\rTidy data must be stored in data frames. We introduced the data frame in Section ?? and have been using the murders data frame throughout the unit. In Section ?? we introduced the group_by function, which permits stratifying data before computing summary statistics.

We can learn the class of the returned object using:\nmurders %\u0026gt;% group_by(region) %\u0026gt;% class()\r## [1] \u0026quot;grouped_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\rThe tbl, pronounced tibble, is a special kind of data frame. The functions group_by and summarize always return this type of data frame. The group_by function returns a special kind of tbl, the grouped_df. We will say more about these later. For consistency, the dplyr manipulation verbs (select, filter, mutate, and arrange) preserve the class of the input: if they receive a regular data frame they return a regular data frame, while if they receive a tibble they return a tibble. But tibbles are the preferred format in the tidyverse and as a result tidyverse functions that produce a data frame from scratch return a tibble.\nTibbles are very similar to data frames. In fact, you can think of them as a modern version of data frames. Nonetheless there are three important differences which we describe next.\nTibbles display better\rThe print method for tibbles is more readable than that of a data frame. To see this, compare the outputs of typing murders and the output of murders if we convert it to a tibble. We can do this using as_tibble(murders). If using RStudio, output for a tibble adjusts to your window size. To see this, change the width of your R console and notice how more/less columns are shown.\n\rSubsets of tibbles are tibbles\rIf you subset the columns of a data frame, you may get back an object that is not a data frame, such as a vector or scalar. For example:\nclass(murders[,4])\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\ris not a data frame. With tibbles this does not happen:\nclass(as_tibble(murders)[,4])\r## [1] \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\rThis is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input.\nWith tibbles, if you want to access the vector that defines a column, and not get back a data frame, you need to use the accessor $:\nclass(as_tibble(murders)$population)\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\rA related feature is that tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist. If we accidentally write Population instead of population this:\nmurders$Population\r## NULL\rreturns a NULL with no warning, which can make it harder to debug. In contrast, if we try this with a tibble we get an informative warning:\nas_tibble(murders)$Population\r## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `Population`.\r## NULL\r\rTibbles can have complex entries\rWhile data frame columns need to be vectors of numbers, strings, or logical values, tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions. Also, we can create tibbles with functions:\ntibble(id = c(1, 2, 3), func = c(mean, median, sd))\r## # A tibble: 3 × 2\r## id func ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;list\u0026gt;\r## 1 1 \u0026lt;fn\u0026gt; ## 2 2 \u0026lt;fn\u0026gt; ## 3 3 \u0026lt;fn\u0026gt;\r\rTibbles can be grouped\rThe function group_by returns a special kind of tibble: a grouped tibble. This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which groups. The tidyverse functions, in particular the summarize function, are aware of the group information.\n\rCreate a tibble using tibble instead of data.frame\rIt is sometimes useful for us to create our own data frames. To create a data frame in the tibble format, you can do this by using the tibble function.\ngrades \u0026lt;- tibble(names = c(\u0026quot;John\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Juan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Jean\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Yao\u0026quot;),\rexam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),\rexam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))\rNote that base R (without packages loaded) has a function with a very similar name, data.frame, that can be used to create a regular data frame rather than a tibble. One other important difference is that by default data.frame coerces characters into factors without providing a warning or message:\ngrades \u0026lt;- data.frame(names = c(\u0026quot;John\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Juan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Jean\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Yao\u0026quot;),\rexam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),\rexam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))\rclass(grades$names)\r## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;\rTo avoid this, we use the rather cumbersome argument stringsAsFactors:\ngrades \u0026lt;- data.frame(names = c(\u0026quot;John\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Juan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Jean\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Yao\u0026quot;),\rexam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),\rexam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90),\rstringsAsFactors = FALSE)\rclass(grades$names)\r## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;\rTo convert a regular data frame to a tibble, you can use the as_tibble function.\nas_tibble(grades) %\u0026gt;% class()\r## [1] \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\r\r\rThe dot operator\rOne of the advantages of using the pipe %\u0026gt;% is that we do not have to keep naming new objects as we manipulate the data frame. As a quick reminder, if we want to compute the median murder rate for states in the southern states, instead of typing:\ntab_1 \u0026lt;- filter(murders, region == \u0026quot;South\u0026quot;)\rtab_2 \u0026lt;- mutate(tab_1, rate = total / population * 10^5)\rrates \u0026lt;- tab_2$rate\rmedian(rates)\r## [1] 3.398069\rWe can avoid defining any new intermediate objects by instead typing:\nfilter(murders, region == \u0026quot;South\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(median = median(rate)) %\u0026gt;%\rpull(median)\r## [1] 3.398069\rWe can do this because each of these functions takes a data frame as the first argument. But what if we want to access a component of the data frame. For example, what if the pull function was not available and we wanted to access tab_2$rate? What data frame name would we use? The answer is the dot operator.\nFor example to access the rate vector without the pull function we could use\nrates \u0026lt;- filter(murders, region == \u0026quot;South\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %\u0026gt;%\r.$rate\rmedian(rates)\r## [1] 3.398069\rIn the next section, we will see other instances in which using the . is useful.\n\rdo\rThe tidyverse functions know how to interpret grouped tibbles. Furthermore, to facilitate stringing commands through the pipe %\u0026gt;%, tidyverse functions consistently take data frames and return data frames, since this assures that the output of a function is accepted as the input of another. But most R functions do not recognize grouped tibbles nor do they return data frames. The quantile function is an example we described earlier. The do function serves as a bridge between R functions such as quantile and the tidyverse. The do function understands grouped tibbles and always returns a data frame.\nIn the summarize section (above), we noted that if we attempt to use quantile to obtain the min, median and max in one call, we will receive something unexpected. Prior to R 4.1, we would receive an error. After R 4.1, we actually get:\ndata(heights)\rheights %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(sex == \u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))\rWe probably wanted three columns: min, median, and max. We can use the do function to fix this.\nFirst we have to write a function that fits into the tidyverse approach: that is, it receives a data frame and returns a data frame. Note that it returns a single-row data frame.\nmy_summary \u0026lt;- function(dat){\rx \u0026lt;- quantile(dat$height, c(0, 0.5, 1))\rtibble(min = x[1], median = x[2], max = x[3])\r}\rWe can now apply the function to the heights dataset to obtain the summaries:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(sex) %\u0026gt;%\rmy_summary\r## # A tibble: 1 × 3\r## min median max\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 50 68.5 82.7\rBut this is not what we want. We want a summary for each sex and the code returned just one summary. This is because my_summary is not part of the tidyverse and does not know how to handled grouped tibbles. do makes this connection:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(sex) %\u0026gt;%\rdo(my_summary(.))\r## # A tibble: 2 × 4\r## # Groups: sex [2]\r## sex min median max\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Female 51 65.0 79 ## 2 Male 50 69 82.7\rNote that here we need to use the dot operator. The tibble created by group_by is piped to do. Within the call to do, the name of this tibble is . and we want to send it to my_summary. If you do not use the dot, then my_summary has no argument and returns an error telling us that argument \"dat\" is missing. You can see the error by typing:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(sex) %\u0026gt;%\rdo(my_summary())\rIf you do not use the parenthesis, then the function is not executed and instead do tries to return the function. This gives an error because do must always return a data frame. You can see the error by typing:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(sex) %\u0026gt;%\rdo(my_summary)\rSo do serves as a bridge between non-tidyverse functions and the tidyverse.\n\rThe purrr package\rIn previous sections (and labs) we learned about the sapply function, which permitted us to apply the same function to each element of a vector. We constructed a function and used sapply to compute the sum of the first n integers for several values of n like this:\ncompute_s_n \u0026lt;- function(n){\rx \u0026lt;- 1:n\rsum(x)\r}\rn \u0026lt;- 1:25\rs_n \u0026lt;- sapply(n, compute_s_n)\rs_n\r## [1] 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55 66 78 91 105 120 136 153 171 190\r## [20] 210 231 253 276 300 325\rThis type of operation, applying the same function or procedure to elements of an object, is quite common in data analysis. The purrr package includes functions similar to sapply but that better interact with other tidyverse functions. The main advantage is that we can better control the output type of functions. In contrast, sapply can return several different object types; for example, we might expect a numeric result from a line of code, but sapply might convert our result to character under some circumstances. purrr functions will never do this: they will return objects of a specified type or return an error if this is not possible.\nThe first purrr function we will learn is map, which works very similar to sapply but always, without exception, returns a list:\nlibrary(purrr) # or library(tidyverse)\rn \u0026lt;- 1:25\rs_n \u0026lt;- map(n, compute_s_n)\rclass(s_n)\r## [1] \u0026quot;list\u0026quot;\rIf we want a numeric vector, we can instead use map_dbl which always returns a vector of numeric values.\ns_n \u0026lt;- map_dbl(n, compute_s_n)\rclass(s_n)\r## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\rThis produces the same results as the sapply call shown above.\nA particularly useful purrr function for interacting with the rest of the tidyverse is map_df, which always returns a tibble data frame. However, the function being called needs to return a vector or a list with names. For this reason, the following code would result in a Argument 1 must have names error:\ns_n \u0026lt;- map_df(n, compute_s_n)\rWe need to change the function to make this work:\ncompute_s_n \u0026lt;- function(n){\rx \u0026lt;- 1:n\rtibble(sum = sum(x))\r}\rs_n \u0026lt;- map_df(n, compute_s_n)\rhead(s_n)\r## # A tibble: 6 × 1\r## sum\r## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 1\r## 2 3\r## 3 6\r## 4 10\r## 5 15\r## 6 21\rBecause map_df returns a tibble, we can have more columns defined in our function and returned.\ncompute_s_n2 \u0026lt;- function(n){\rx \u0026lt;- 1:n\rtibble(sum = sum(x), sumSquared = sum(x^2))\r}\rs_n \u0026lt;- map_df(n, compute_s_n2)\rhead(s_n)\r## # A tibble: 6 × 2\r## sum sumSquared\r## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 1 1\r## 2 3 5\r## 3 6 14\r## 4 10 30\r## 5 15 55\r## 6 21 91\rThe purrr package provides much more functionality not covered here. For more details you can consult this online resource.\n\rTidyverse conditionals\rA typical data analysis will often involve one or more conditional operations. In the section on Conditionals, we described the ifelse function, which we will use extensively in this book. In this section we present two dplyr functions that provide further functionality for performing conditional operations.\ncase_when\rThe case_when function is useful for vectorizing conditional statements. It is similar to ifelse but can output any number of values, as opposed to just TRUE or FALSE. Here is an example splitting numbers into negative, positive, and 0:\nx \u0026lt;- c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)\rcase_when(x \u0026lt; 0 ~ \u0026quot;Negative\u0026quot;,\rx \u0026gt; 0 ~ \u0026quot;Positive\u0026quot;,\rx == 0 ~ \u0026quot;Zero\u0026quot;)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Negative\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Negative\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Zero\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Positive\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Positive\u0026quot;\rA common use for this function is to define categorical variables based on existing variables. For example, suppose we want to compare the murder rates in four groups of states: New England, West Coast, South, and other. For each state, we need to ask if it is in New England, if it is not we ask if it is in the West Coast, if not we ask if it is in the South, and if not we assign other. Here is how we use case_when to do this:\nmurders %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(group = case_when(\rabb %in% c(\u0026quot;ME\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NH\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RI\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CT\u0026quot;) ~ \u0026quot;New England\u0026quot;,\rabb %in% c(\u0026quot;WA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;OR\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CA\u0026quot;) ~ \u0026quot;West Coast\u0026quot;,\rregion == \u0026quot;South\u0026quot; ~ \u0026quot;South\u0026quot;,\rTRUE ~ \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(group) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 10^5)\r## # A tibble: 4 × 2\r## group rate\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 New England 1.72\r## 2 Other 2.71\r## 3 South 3.63\r## 4 West Coast 2.90\rThat TRUE on the fourth line of case_when serves as a catch-all. As case_when steps through the conditions, if none of them are true, it comes to the last line. Since TRUE is always true, the function will return “Other”. Leaving out the last line of case_when would result in NA values for any observation that fails the first three conditionals. This may or may not be what you want.\n\rbetween\rA common operation in data analysis is to determine if a value falls inside an interval. We can check this using conditionals. For example, to check if the elements of a vector x are between a and b we can type\nx \u0026gt;= a \u0026amp; x \u0026lt;= b\rHowever, this can become cumbersome, especially within the tidyverse approach. The between function performs the same operation.\nbetween(x, a, b)\rTRY IT\nLoad the murders dataset.

The first column should contain the numbers 1 through 100.

Rats in NYC are plentiful, but they also deliver food, so they’re useful too.\n   NYC keeps incredibly detailed data regarding animal sightings, including rats, and it makes this data publicly available.\nFor this first project, pretend that you are an analyst with the NYC Mayor’s office, and you have been tasked with getting a better understanding of the rat problem. Your job is to use R and ggplot2 to tell an interesting story hidden in the data. You must create a story by looking carefully at the data, finding some insight into where or when rat sightings occur, and describing to the Mayor how this insight may inform a strategy to address the rats. Your assignment will take the form of a memo that presents the data and insights along with appropriate visualizations that communicate the story in-line. Your memo should be approximately 2-4 pages (including plots) and, of course, will use Rmarkdown rendered to PDF using LaTeX.\nInstructions\rHere’s what you need to do:\nDownload New York City’s database of rat sightings since 2010:\n\r Rat_sightings.csv\r\rSummarize the data somehow. The raw data has more than 100,000 rows, which means you’ll need to aggregate the data (filter(), group_by(), and summarize() will be your friends). Consider looking at the number of sightings per borough, per year, per dwelling type, etc., or a combination of these, like the change in the number sightings across the 5 boroughs between 2010 and 2016.\n\rCreate an appropriate visualization based on the data you summarized.\n\rWrite a polished, professional memo presenting your analysis. We are specifically looking for a discussion of the following:\n\rWhat story are you telling with your new graphic?\rHow have you applied reasonable standards in visual storytelling?\rWhat policy implication is there (if any)?\r\rUpload the following outputs to D2L:\n\rA PDF file of your memo with your graphics embedded in it.1 This means you’ll need to do all your coding in an R Markdown file and embed your code in chunks.\rNote that Part 2 of this project should be included in this PDF in it’s own section (see below).\rNothing else. No .Rmd, no code, nothing but your clean, polished memo with Part 1 and Part 2.\r\r\rSome important notes on your assignment\n\rYour assignment should be clean and polished as if you were a city employee and you were turning in a work product. It should should flow nicely and use subsections (using ### at the start of the line) as appropriate.\rDo not “annotate” your thought process (e.g. do not write “we tried X but there were too many NA’s, so we did Y instead”). This should be a polished memo suitable for turning in as a work product.\rYour code should not appear in your output - it should be only your plots and memo writing.\r\rTo turn off code echoing, add echo = FALSE in each of your code chunk options (e.g. {r setup, echo = FALSE}), or set it globally in the first code chunk inside the knitr::opts_chunk$set function.\r\r\r\rStarter code\rI’ve provided some starter code below. A couple comments about it:\n\rBy default, read_csv() treats cells that are empty or “NA” as missing values. This rat dataset uses “N/A” to mark missing values, so we need to add that as a possible marker of missingness (hence na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"N/A\"))\rTo make life easier, I’ve renamed some of the key variables you might work with. You can rename others if you want.\rI’ve also created a few date-related variables (sighting_year, sighting_month, sighting_day, and sighting_weekday). You don’t have to use them, but they’re there if you need them. The functions that create these, like year() and wday() are part of the lubridate library.\rThe date/time variables are formatted like 04/03/2017 12:00:00 AM, which R is not able to automatically parse as a date when reading the CSV file. You can use the mdy_hms() function in the lubridate library to parse dates that are structured as “month-day-year-hour-minute”.

Your group must identify three different data sources2 for potential use in your final project. You are not bound to this decision.\nDo not use Kaggle data. While Kaggle is useful for learning data science, part of this assignment is learning how to find actual data in the wild.\nFor each dataset, you must write a single short paragraph about what about this data interests you. Add this to the memo from Part 1, using ## to make a new header in Rmarkdown for this section.\n\rEvaluations\rI will evaluate these projects (not the TA). I will only give top marks to those groups showing initiative and cleverness. I will use the following weights for final scores:\nPart 1\nTechnical difficulty: Does the final project show mastery of the skills we’ve discussed thus far? Are axes and legends appropriately labeled? (12 points)\n\rAppropriateness of visuals: Do the visualizations tell a clear story? Have we learned something? (10 points)\n\rStorytelling: Does your memo clearly convey what you’re doing and why? (10 points)\n\r\rPart 2\nEach piece of data (and description) is worth 6 points. (18 points total)\n.small[Updated 4-4-2022]\n\r\rYou can approach this in a couple different ways—you can write the memo and then include the full figure and code at the end, similar to this blog post, or you can write the memo in an incremental way, describing the different steps of creating the figure, ultimately arriving at a clean final figure, like this blog post.↩︎\n\rThe three different sources need not be different websites or from different organizations.

For this initial week, please read the course content. Read closely the following:\n\rThe syllabus, content, examples, and labs pages for this class.\rThis page. Yes, the whole thing.\r\rGuiding Question\rFor future lectures, the guiding questions will be more pointed and at a higher level to help steer your thinking. Here, we want to ensure you remember some basics and accordingly the questions are straightforward.\n\rHow does this course work?\rDo you remember anything about R?\rWhat are the different data types in R?\rHow do you index specific elements of a vector? Why might you want to do that?\r\r\r\rA Brief Introduction to SSC442\rAbout Me\rMe: My primary area of expertise is environmental and energy (applied) economics.\nThis class is totally, unapologetically a work in progress. It was developed mainly by Prof. Bushong with refinements by myself.\nMaterial is a mish-mash of stuff from courses offered at Caltech, Stanford, Harvard, and Duke…so, yeah, it will be challenging. Hopefully, you’ll find it fun!\nMy research: occasionally touches the topics in the course, but mostly utilizes things in the course as tools.\n\rAbout You\rNew phone who dis? Please email me jkirk@msu.edu with the subject [SSC442] Who Dis. In the message, tell me:\n\rname (with pronunciation guide)\n\rmajor\n\rdesired graduation year and semester\n\rinterest in this course on a 10-point scale (1: not at all interested; 10: helllllll yeah)\n\r\r\rYou must spend 5 minutes emailing me a little bit about your interests before the next class. This counts towards your “participation” grade (more on that later)\n\rThis Course\rThe syllabus is posted on the course website. I’ll walk through highlights now, but read it later – it’s long.\n\rBut eventually, please read it. It is required.\r\rSyllabus highlights:\n\rGrade is composed of weekly writings, labs, and projects (see syllabus page for exact points)\r\rWeekly writings: 19%\rParticipation: 4%\rLabs: 32%\rProjects: 45%\r\rThis structure is designed to give ~55% “for free”. Success on the projects will require real work.\rLabs consist of a practical implementation of something we’ve covered in the course (e.g., code your own Recommender System).\r\rCourse Structure\rHere’s how each week will work: before class on Tuesday, you’ll read the content for the week. On Tuesday, you’ll come to lecture. Before Thursday, you’ll read the example for the week, and on Thursday you’ll come to lecture ready to participate with a charged laptop. On Saturday night by 11:59pm, you’ll turn in your Weekly Writing assignment responding to the weekly writing prompt given during class on Tuesday or Thursday, rendered to PDF by RMarkdown and using the proper template (see assignments). By Monday at 11:59pm, you’ll turn in your Lab assignment, also using the RMarkdown template.\nYou’ll repeat this each week until we’re out of labs. If a holiday occurs on a due date, then the assignment or lab is due the next non-holiday day at 11:59pm. You’ll also work with your assigned group on the Group Project. We’ll assign groups after the drop deadline has passed.\nNow, let’s look at the Syllabus for important information about office hours\n\rGrading\rGrading: come to class.\nIf you complete all assignments and attend all class dates, I suspect you will do very well. Given the way the syllabus is structured, I conjecture that the following is a loose guide to grades:\n4.0 Turned in all assignments with good effort, worked hard on the projects and was proud of final product.\n3.5 Turned in all assignments with good effort, worked a bit on the projects and was indifferent to final product.\n3.0 Turned in all assignments with some effort, worked a bit on the projects and was shy about final product.\n\u0026lt; 3.0 Very little effort, or did not turn in all assignments, worked very little on the projects and was embarassed by final product.\n…of course, failing to turn in assignments can lead to a grade dramatically lower than just a 3.0.\n\r\rMore About This Course\rThere are sort of two texts for this course and sort of zero.\nThe “main text” is this website. The secondary text is Introduction to Statistical Learning (see Syllabus), which is free and available online. The secondary text is substantially more difficult, but also free online. Assigned readings can be found on the course website under “Content”.\nPlease please please please please: ask questions during class.\n\rMost ideas will be new.\n\rSometimes (often?) the material itself will be confusing or interesting—or both!\n\rTeaching online is incredibly challenging (no feedback) and chat is vital to success. We’re back in person and I/we have a healthy aversion to zoom!\n\rNote: If I find that attendance is terrible, I may have to start incorporating attendance into participation.\n\r\rReturn of the Please: If there is some topic that you really want to learn about, ask. If you are uncomfortable asking in front of the whole group, please see me during office hours.\nBecause this is a new-ish course:\n\rSome of the lectures will be way too long or too short.\n\rSome of the lectures won’t make sense at first\n\rSome of the time I’ll forget what I intended to say and awkwardly stare at you for a few moments (sorry).\n\r\rComment throughout the course, not just at the end.\nI encourage measured feedback and thoughtful responses to questions. If I call on you and you don’t know immediately, don’t freak out. If you don’t know, it’s totally okay to say you don’t know.\nSUPER BIG IMPORTANT EXPLANATION OF THE COURSE\rI teach using “math”.\n…Don’t be afraid. The math won’t hurt you.\nI fundamentally believe that true knowledge of how we learn from data depends on a basic understanding of the underlying mathematics.\n-Good news: no black boxes.\n\rYou’ll actually learn stuff. (Probably. Hopefully?)\n\rAlso good news: level of required math is reasonably low. High-school algebra or equivalent should be fine.\n\r\r-Bad news: some notation-heavy slides and reading.\n\r\rAnd finally…\rFinally: I cannot address field-specific questions in areas outside economics to any satisfying degree.\n\rGood news: I’m good at knowing what I don’t know and have a very small ego, which means that I’m much less likely to blow smoke up your rear than other professors.\n\rBad news: I can’t help with certain types of questions.\n\r\rThis course should be applicable broadly, but many of the examples will lean on my personal expertise (sorry).\nYour assignment: read syllabus, the content from Week 0 if you haven’t already, and the Example from Week 0 for Thursday. Make sure R and RStudio is running on your computer or you have a RStudio.cloud/Posit.cloud account, and make sure you can knit your Rmarkdown template to PDF. Do your weekly writing due Saturday. Begin working on Lab 0 as it is due Monday.\nThings to stress from syllabus:\n\rE-mail isn’t the ideal solution for technical problems\r\rIf you do send an email, please start it with [SSC442] and the subject.\r\rNo appointments necessary for regularly scheduled office hours; or by appointment and via Slack\rTA office hours are great as well. Our TA has experience in this course.\rNotify me immediately if you need accommodations because of RCPD or religious convictions; If you approach me at the last minute, I may not be able to help.\r\rDespite my hard-assness in these intro slides: I’m here to help and I am not in the business of giving bad grades for no reason.\n\r\rWhat is “Data Analytics”?\r\rI keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. And I’m not kidding.\n\rHal Varian, Chief Economist, Google\rHow do you define “data analytics”? (Not a rhetorical question!)\n\rThis course will avoid this nomenclature. It is confusing and imprecise. But you signed up (suckers) and I owe an explanation of what this course will cover.\r\rSome “data analytics” topics we will cover:\n\rLinear regression: il classico.\rLASSO\rModels of classification or discrete choice.\rAnalysis of ``wide’’ data.\rDecision trees and other non-linear models.\r\r\rStarting point for this course\rBetter utilizing existing data can improve our predictive power whilst providing interpretable outputs for considering new policies.\nWARNING: Causation is tough and we will spend the entire course warning you to avoid making causal claims!\nNon-Social Science Approaches to Statistical Learning\rA Brief History\nSuppose you are a researcher and you want to teach a computer to recognize images of a tree.\nNote: this is an ``easy” problem. If you show pictures to a 3-year-old, that child will probably be able to tell you if there is a tree in the picture.\nComputer scientists spent about 20 years on this problem because they thought about the problem like nerds and tried to write down a series of rules.\nRules are difficult to form, and simply writing rules misses the key insight: the data can tell you something.\n\rSocial Science Approaches to Statistical Learning\rA Brief History\nSuppose you are a researcher and you want to know whether prisons reduce crime.\nfrom “A Call for a Moratorium on Prison Building” (1976)\n\rBetween 1955 and 1975, fifteen states increased the collective capacity of their adult prison systems by 56% (from, on average, 63,100 to 98,649).\rFifteen other states increased capacity by less than 4% (from 49,575 to 51,440).\rIn “heavy-construction” states the crime rate increased by 167%; in “low-construction” states the crime rate increased by 145%.\r\r\r\r\rPrison Capacity\rCrime Rate\r\r\r\rHigh construction\r\\(\\uparrow\\)~56%\r\\(\\uparrow\\)~167%\r\rLow construction\r\\(\\uparrow\\)~4%\r\\(\\uparrow\\)~145%\r\r\r\r\rThe Pros and Cons of Correlation\rPros:\n\rNature gives you correlations for free.\rIn principle, everyone can agree on the facts.\r\rCons:\n\rCorrelations are not very helpful.\rThey show what has happened, but not why.\rFor many things, we care about why. The social science perspective asks “why?”\r\rWhy a Correlation Exists Between X and Y\r\\(X \\rightarrow Y\\)\rX causes Y (causality)\n\r\\(X \\leftarrow Y\\)\rY causes X (reverse causality)\n\r\\(Z \\rightarrow X\\); \\(Z \\rightarrow Y\\)\rZ causes X and Y (common cause)\n\r\\(X \\rightarrow Y\\); \\(Y \\rightarrow X\\)\rX causes Y and Y causes X (simultaneous equations)\n\r\r\rUniting Social Science and Computer Science\rWe will start in this course by examining situations where we do not care about why something has happened, but instead we care about our ability to predict its occurrence from existing data.\n(But of course keep in back of mind that if you are making policy, you must care about why something happened).\nWe will also borrow a few other ideas from CS:\n\rAnything is data\r\rSatellite data\rUnstructured text or audio\rFacial expressions or vocal intonations\r\rSubtle improvements on existing techniques\rAn eye towards practical implementability over “cleanliness”\r\r\r\rA Case Study in Prediction\rExample: a firm wishes to predict user behavior based on previous purchases or interactions.\nSmall margins \\(\\rightarrow\\) huge payoffs when scaled up.\n\\(.01\\% \\rightarrow\\) $10 million.\nNot obvious why this was true for Netflix; quite obvious why this is true in financial markets.\nFrom a computer science perspective, it only matters that you get that improvement ($$). From a social science perspective, we would want to use the predictions to learn more about why.\n\rMore Recent Examples of Prediction\r\rIdentify the risk factors for prostate cancer.\rClassify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes, based on a gene expression profile.\rClassify a recorded phoneme based on a log-periodogram.\rPredict whether someone will have a heart attack on the basis of demographic, diet and clinical measurements.\rCustomize an email spam detection system.\rIdentify a hand-drawn object.\rDetermine which oscillations of stellar luminosity are likely due to exoplanets.\rIdentify food combinations that cause spikes in blood glucose level for an individual.\rEstablish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey data.\r\r\rAn Aside: Nomenclature\rMachine learning arose as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.\nStatistical learning arose as a subfield of Statistics.\nThere is much overlap; however, a few points of distinction:\n\rMachine learning has a greater emphasis on large scale applications and prediction accuracy.\n\rStatistical learning emphasizes models and their interpretability, and precision and uncertainty.\n\rBut the distinction has become more and more blurred, and there is a great deal of “cross-fertilization”.\r\r\rObviously true: machine learning has the upper hand in marketing.\n\rLearning from Data\rThe following are the basic requirements for statistical learning:\nA pattern exists.\rThis pattern is not easily expressed in a closed mathematical form.\rYou have data.\r\r\r\rCase study: US homicides by firearm\rImagine you live in Europe (if only!) and are offered a job in a US company with many locations in every state. It is a great job, but headlines such as US Gun Homicide Rate Higher Than Other Developed Countries1 have you worried. Fox News runs a scary looking graphic, and charts like the one below only add to that concern:\nOr even worse, this version from everytown.org:\rBut then you remember that (1) this is a hypothetical exercise; (2) you’ll take literally any job at this point; and (3) Geographic diversity matters – the United States is a large and diverse country with 50 very different states (plus the District of Columbia and some lovely territories).2\nCalifornia, for example, has a larger population than Canada, and 20 US states have populations larger than that of Norway. In some respects, the variability across states in the US is akin to the variability across countries in Europe. Furthermore, although not included in the charts above, the murder rates in Lithuania, Ukraine, and Russia are higher than 4 per 100,000. So perhaps the news reports that worried you are too superficial.\nThis is a relatively simple and straightforward problem in social science: you have options of where to live, and want to determine the safety of the various states. Your “research” is clearly policy-relevant: you will eventually have to live somewhere. In this course, we will begin to tackle the problem by examining data related to gun homicides in the US during 2010 using R as a motivating example along the way.\nBefore we get started with our example, we need to cover logistics as well as some of the very basic building blocks that are required to gain more advanced R skills. Ideally, this is a refresher. However, we are aware that your preparation in previously courses varies greatly from student to student. Moreover, we want you to be aware that the usefulness of some of these early building blocks may not be immediately obvious. Later in the class you will appreciate having these skills. Mastery will be rewarded both in this class and (of course) in life.\nLet’s pause here for questions\r\r\rGetting started with R and RStudio Posit Workflows\rIn Content this week, we reviewed the use of R. Now, let’s talk about doing work in R.\nR is not a programming language like C or Java. It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. You can read the full history in the paper A Brief History of S3. The interactivity is an indispensable feature in data science because, as you will soon learn, the ability to quickly explore data is a necessity for success in this field. However, like in other programming languages, you can save your work as scripts that can be easily executed at any moment. These scripts serve as a record of the analysis you performed, a key feature that facilitates reproducible work. If you are an expert programmer, you should not expect R to follow the conventions you are used—assuming this will leave you disappointed. If you are patient, you will come to appreciate the unequal power of R when it comes to data analysis and data visualization.\nOther attractive features of R are:\nR is free and open source4.\rIt runs on all major platforms: Windows, Mac OS, UNIX/Linux.\rScripts and data objects can be shared seamlessly across platforms.\rThere is a large, growing, and active community of R users and, as a result, there are numerous resources for learning and asking questions5 6 7.\rIt is easy for others to contribute add-ons which enables developers to share software implementations of new data science methodologies. The latest methods and tools are developed in R for a wide variety of disciplines and since social science is so broad, R is one of the few tools that spans the varied social sciences.\r\rInstalling R and RStudio Posit\rIf you have not yet done so, you’ll need to install both R and RStudio/Posit (as we mentioned before, RStudio is undergoing a change in name). See the Installing page of our course resources for instructions.\nI have created a video walkthrough for the basics of using R for another course, but it is useful here. You can see part A here (labeled “Part 2a”) here ] and part B here (labeled “Part 2b”) . You should already be at this level of familiarity with R, but if you need a review, this is a good place to start.\n\r\rThe R console\rInteractive data analysis usually occurs on the R console that executes commands as you type them. There are several ways to gain access to an R console. One way is to simply start R on your computer. R Studio runs R inside of, so you won’t usually access R this way. The console looks something like this:\nAs a quick example, try using the console to calculate a 15% tip on a meal that cost $19.71:8\n0.15 * 19.71 \r## [1] 2.9565\rNote that in this course (at least, on most browsers), grey boxes are used to show R code typed into the R console. The symbol ## is used to denote what the R console outputs.\n\rScripts\rOne of the great advantages of R over point-and-click analysis software is that you can save your work as scripts. You can edit and save these scripts using a text editor. The material in this course was developed using the interactive integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio9. RStudio includes an editor with many R specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures.\nMost web-based R consoles also provide a pane to edit scripts, but not all permit you to save the scripts for later use. On the upper-right part of this webpage you’ll see a little button with the R logo. You can access a web-based console there.\n\rRStudio\rRStudio (undergoing a re-brand to “Posit”) will be our launching pad for data science projects. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.\nThe panes\rWhen you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes. The left pane shows the R console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as Environment and History, while the bottom pane shows five tabs: File, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.\nTo start a new script, you can click on File, then New File, then R Script.\nThis starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.\n\rKey bindings\rMany tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead. These keyboard versions for performing tasks are referred to as key bindings. For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a key binding: Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows and command+shift+N on the Mac.\nAlthough in this tutorial we often show how to use the mouse, we highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. You might want to keep this handy so you can look up key-bindings when you find yourself performing repetitive point-and-clicking.\n\rRunning commands while editing scripts\rThere are many editors specifically made for coding. These are useful because color and indentation are automatically added to make code more readable. RStudio is one of these editors, and it was specifically developed for R. One of the main advantages provided by RStudio over other editors is that we can test our code easily as we edit our scripts. Below we show an example.\nLet’s start by opening a new script as we did before. A next step is to give the script a name. We can do this through the editor by saving the current new unnamed script. To do this, click on the save icon or use the key binding Ctrl+S on Windows and command+S on the Mac.\nWhen you ask for the document to be saved for the first time, RStudio will prompt you for a name. A good convention is to use a descriptive name, with lower case letters, no spaces, only hyphens to separate words, and then followed by the suffix .R. We will call this script my-first-script.R.\nNow we are ready to start editing our first script. The first lines of code in an R script are dedicated to loading the libraries we will use. Another useful RStudio feature is that once we type library() it starts auto-completing with libraries that we have installed. Note what happens when we type library(ti):\nAnother feature you may have noticed is that when you type library( the second parenthesis is automatically added. This will help you avoid one of the most common errors in coding: forgetting to close a parenthesis.\nNow we can continue to write code. As an example, we will make a graph showing murder totals versus population totals by state. Once you are done writing the code needed to make this plot, you can try it out by executing the code. To do this, click on the Run button on the upper right side of the editing pane. You can also use the key binding: Ctrl+Shift+Enter on Windows or command+shift+return on the Mac.\nOnce you run the code, you will see it appear in the R console and, in this case, the generated plot appears in the plots console. Note that the plot console has a useful interface that permits you to click back and forward across different plots, zoom in to the plot, or save the plots as files.\nTo run one line at a time instead of the entire script, you can use Control-Enter on Windows and command-return on the Mac.\nSETUP TIP\nChange the option Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never and uncheck the Restore .RData into workspace at start. By default, when you exit R saves all the objects you have created into a file called .RData. This is done so that when you restart the session in the same folder, it will load these objects. I find that this causes confusion especially when sharing code with colleagues or peers.\n\r\r\rInstalling R packages\rThe functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as base R. The extra functionality comes from add-ons available from developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, R instead makes different components available via packages. R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the dslabs package, which we use to share datasets and code related to this course, you would type directly into the console:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;dslabs\u0026quot;)\rIn RStudio, you can navigate to the Tools tab and select install packages. We can then load the package into our R sessions using the library function:\nlibrary(dslabs)\rAs you go through this course, you will see that we load packages without installing them. This is because once you install a package, it remains installed and only needs to be loaded with library. The package remains loaded until we quit the R session. If you try to load a package and get an error, it probably means you need to install it first.\nThis also means that strange things can happen if you add install.packages() to a script – you’ll be re-installing the package every time you run the script, and that will lead to errors. Lots of them. So you install the packages once and only once on your computer via the packages pane or directly in the console, then you never install that package again.\nWe can install more than one package at once by feeding a character vector to this function:\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dslabs\u0026quot;))\rOne advantage of using RStudio is that it auto-completes package names once you start typing, which is helpful when you do not remember the exact spelling of the package. Once you select your package, we recommend selecting all the defaults. Note that installing tidyverse actually installs several packages. This commonly occurs when a package has dependencies, or uses functions from other packages. When you load a package using library, you also load its dependencies.\nOnce packages are installed, you can load them into R and you do not need to install them again, unless you install a fresh version of R. Remember packages are installed in R not RStudio.\nIt is helpful to keep a list of all the packages you need for your work in a script because if you need to perform a fresh install of R, you can re-install all your packages by simply running a script.\nYou can see all the packages you have installed using the following function:\ninstalled.packages()\rAs we move through this course, we will constantly be adding to our toolbox of packages. Accordingly, you will need to keep track to ensure you have the requisite package for any given lecture.\n\rRmarkdown\rMarkdown is a general-purpose syntax for laying out documents. Rmarkdown is a combination of R and markdown, as the name implies. When using markdown, one can define headers and tables using specific notation, and depending on the rendering engine, the headers and tables (and a whole lot more) are customized. In fact, this whole website is built in R using Rmarkdown (and a lot of add-ons like Hugo and blogdown). In other contexts, the rendering engine may recognize that your headers are likely to be entries in a table of contents, and does so for you. The table of contents at the top of this document is built from the markdown headers.\nThe power of Rmarkdown is that it lets us mix formatted text with R code. That is, you can have a section of the document that understands R code, and a separate section right after that discusses the results from the R code.\nTry it out using the Weekly Writing Template from the Assignments tab. If it opens in your web browser, just right-click the link and select Save As…. Make sure you save the file to its own folder on your hard drive. In converting your Rmarkdown .Rmd file to a .pdf, your system will make multiple interim files10. It also creates folders to store the output of any plots or graphics you create with your R code.\nIf you’re new to Rmarkdown, I have made a short video on how to use it . This video is for my EC420 course, but works for us as well.\nTo use Rmarkdown, you’ll have to install a few packages (like knitr and tinytex) and you’ll have to install a copy of LaTeX installed. Follow these instructions if you haven’t ever used RMarkdown with LaTeX to install LaTeX.\nIf we have time today, let’s open the template linked above and see what happens when we select “knit to pdf”. If you do not wind up with a PDF rendered using LaTeX that looks like the one below, then check for errors. The most common one is not having tinytex and latex installed (tinytex will install a light version of latex).\nScreentshot of header of PDF file properly rendered\n\r\r\r\rhttp://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/us-gun-ownership-homicide-rate-higher-than-other-developed-countries/↩︎\n\rI’m especially partial to Puerto Rico.↩︎\n\rhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b48/46f192aa37ca122cfabb1ed1b59866d8bfda.pdf↩︎\n\rhttps://opensource.org/history↩︎\n\rhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/138/free-resources-for-learning-r↩︎\n\rhttps://www.r-project.org/help.html↩︎\n\rhttps://stackoverflow.com/documentation/r/topics↩︎\n\rBut probably tip more than 15%.

You can join our Slack channel with this link by September 20th\n\r\rWhat is This Course and Can / Should You Take It?\rInnovations in statistical learning have created many engineering breakthroughs. From real time voice recognition to automatic categorization (and in some cases production) of news stories, machine learning is transforming the way we live our lives. These techniques are, at their heart, novel ways to work with data, and therefore they should have implications for social science. This course explores the intersection of statistical learning (or machine learning) and social science and aims to answer two primary questions about these new techniques:\nHow does statistical learning work and what kinds of statistical guarantees can be made about the performance of statistical-learning algorithms?\n\rHow can statistical learning be used to answer questions that interest social science researchers, such as testing theories or improving social policy?\n\r\rIn order to address these questions, we will cover so-called “standard” techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, statistical learning theory and nonparametric and Bayesian approaches. If it were up to me, this course would be titled “Statistical Learning for Social Scientists”—I believe this provides a more appropriate guide to the content of this course. And while this class will cover these novel statistical methodologies in some detail, it is not a substitute for the appropriate class in Computer Science or Statistics. Nor is this a class that teaches specific skills for the job market. Rather, this class will teach you to think about data analytics broadly. We will spend a great deal of time learning how to interpret the output of statistical learning algorithms and approaches, and will also spend a great deal of time on better understanding the basic ideas in statistical learning. This, of course, comes at some cost in terms of time spent on learning computational and/or programming skills.\nEnrollment for credit in this course is simply not suitable for those unprepared in or uninterested in elementary statistical theory no matter the intensity of interest in machine learning or “Big Data”. Really.\nYou will be required to understand elementary mathematics in this course and should have at least some exposure to statistical theory. The class is front-loaded technically: early lectures are more mathematically oriented, while later lectures are more applied.\nThe topics covered in this course are listed later in this document. I will assign readings sparingly from Introduction to Statistical Learning, henceforth referred to as ISL. This text is available for free online and, for those who like physical books, can be purchased for about $25. Importantly, the lectures deviate a fair bit from the reading, and thus you will rely on your course notes much more than you might in other classes.\nIf—after you have read this document and preferably after attending the first lecture—you have any questions about whether this course is appropriate for you, please come talk to me.\n\rWhat This Course is Not\rThe focus of this course is conceptual. The goal is to create a working understanding of when and how tools from computer science and statistics can be profitably applied to problems in social science. Though students will be required to apply some of these techniques themselves, this course is not…\n…a replacement for EC420, EC422, or a course in causal inference.\nAs social scientists, we are most often concerned with causal inference in order to anaOpelyze and write policies. Statistical learning and the other methods we will discuss in this course are generally not well-suited to these problems, and while I’ll give a short overview of standard methods, this is only to build intuitions. Ultimately, this course has a different focus and you should still pursue standard methodological insights from your home departments.\n…a course on the computational aspects of the underlying methods.\nThere are many important innovations that have made machine learning techniques computationally feasible. We will not discuss these, as there are computer science courses better equipped to cover them. When appropriate, we will discuss whether something is computable, and we will even give rough approximations of the amount of time required (e.g. P vs NP). But we will not discuss how optimizers work or best practices in programming.\n…a primer on the nitty-gritty of how to use these tools or a way to pad your resume.\nThe mechanics of implementation, whether it be programming languages or learning to use APIs, will not be covered in any satisfying level of depth. Students will be expected to learn most of the programming skills on their own. Specifically, while there will be some material to remind you of basic R commands, this is not a good course for people who are simply looking to learn the mechanics of programming. This course is designed to get you to use both traditional analytics and, eventually, machine learning tools. We will do some review of basic programming, and you will have the opportunity to explore topics that interest you through a final project, but ultimately this is a course that largely focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of statistical learning as applied to social science and not a class on programming.\nPerhaps most importantly, this course is an attempt to push undergraduate education toward the frontiers in social science. Accordingly, please allow some messiness. Some topics may be underdeveloped for a given person’s passions, but given the wide variety of technical skills and overall interests, this is a near certainty. Both the challenge and opportunity of this area comes from the fact that there is no fully developed, wholly unifying framework. Our collective struggle—me from teaching, you from learning—will ultimately bear fruit.\n\rSuccess in this Course\rI promise, you are equipped to succeed in this course.\nLearning R can be difficult at first. Like learning a new language—Spanish, French, or Chinese—it takes dedication and perseverance. Hadley Wickham (the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like) ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n\rIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\rEven experienced programmers (like me) find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.1 If you’re finding yourself bashing your head against a wall and not making progress, try the following. First, take a break. Sometimes you just need space to see an error. Next, talk to classmates. Finally, if you genuinely cannot see the solution, e-mail the TA. But, honestly, it’s probably just a typo.\n\n\rCourse materials\rThe course website can be found at https://ssc442Kirkpatrick.netlify.app (but you know that. You’re on it right now.)\nAll of the readings and software in this class are free. There are free online version of all the texts including Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd Ed) and R / RStudio are free (don’t pay for RStudio). We will reference outside readings and there exist paper versions of some “books” but you won’t need to buy anything2\nR and RStudio/Posit\rYou will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio (which is undergoing a slow-mo rebrand to “Posit” while the functionality remains the same) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free Posit.cloud (formerly Rstudio.cloud) service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R. We recommend this for those who may be switching between computers and are trying to get some work done. That said, while Posit.cloud is convenient, it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also can’t use your own custom fonts with RStudio.cloud.3 And, generally speaking, you should have (from the prerequisite course) sufficient experience to make your R work. If not, over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. If you plan on making a career out of data science, you should consider this a necessary step.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio/Posit, and all the tidyverse packages here. And you may find some other goodies.\n\rOnline help\rData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”). Likewise, whenever using a specific package, try searching for that package name instead of the letter “r” (e.g. “ggplot scatterplot”). Good, concise searches are generally more effective.\nHelp with Using R: There are some excellent additional tutorials on R available through Rstudio/Posit Clould Primers.\n\r\rEvaluations and Grades\rYour grade in this course will be based on attendance/participation, labs, weekly writings, and a final project.\nThe general breakdown will be approximately 55% for labs, participation, and weekly writings, and 45% for projects (see below for specific details). The primary focus of the course is a final project; this requires two “mini-projects” to ensure you’re making satisfactory progress. Assignment of numeric grades will follow the standard, where ties (e.g., 91.5%) are rounded to favor the student. Evaluations (read: grades) are designed not to deter anyone from taking this course who might otherwise be interested, but will be taken seriously.\nWeekly writings are intended to be an easy way to get some points. Labs will be short homework assignments that require you to do something practical using a basic statistical language. Support will be provided for the R language only. You must have access to computing resources and the ability to program basic statistical analyses. As mentioned above, this course will not teach you how to program or how to write code in a specific language. If you are unprepared to do implement basic statistical coding, please take (or retake) PLS202. I highly encourage seeking coding advice from those who instruct computer science courses – it’s their job and they are better at it than I am. I’ll try to provide a good service, but I’m really not an expert in computer science.\nMore in-depth descriptions for all the assignments are on the assignments page. As the course progresses, the assignments themselves will be posted within that page.\nTo Recap:\n\r\r\rAssignment\rPoints\rPercent\r\r\r\rClass Participation\r25\r5%\r\rWeekly Writings (14-2 x 8 ea),\rdrop two lowest\r96\r18%\r\rLabs (13-1 x 15 ea), drop one\rlowest\r180\r34%\r\rMini project 1\r50\r9%\r\rMini project 2\r50\r9%\r\rFinal project\r135\r25%\r\rTotal\r536\r—\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rGrade\rRange\rGrade\rRange\r\r\r\r4.0\r92-100%\r2.0\r72-76%\r\r3.5\r87-91%\r1.5\r67-72%\r\r3.0\r82-87%\r1.0\r62-67%\r\r2.5\r77-81%\r0.0\rbad-66%\r\r\r\r\rClass Participation\rParticipation can take many forms. Most preferred is active participation during class – asking clarifying questions or responding to lecture questions. In the latter half of the semester, we will work in groups in class on small coding exercises and will share results at the end. Sharing your group’s results and code will always count towards participation. Finally, I will often bribe give extra credit points for answering specific questions in class, which I will clearly state as extra credit. Wrong answers get the same credit as right answers. We are here to learn . If you knew everything already, you wouldn’t be in the class.\n\rAcademic honesty\rViolation of MSU’s Spartan Code of Honor will result in a grade of 0.0 in the course. Moreover, I am required by MSU policy to report suspected cases of academic dishonesty for possible disciplinary action.4\n\rGenerative AI\rGenerative AI is both a computing resource and potential avenue for cheating in violation of the Spartan Code of Honor (see Academic Integrity, below). For this course, some use of generative AI is permitted or forbidden as follows:\n\rFor the purposes of learning R coding, data cleaning and processing, visualization, and other coding applications of R, you are fully permitted to use ChatGPT or other generative AI models provided you indicate such a use at the top of your problem set, and include a comment # used generative AI in your code. When “stuck” on coding, I have always encouraged students to use Stack Overflow to find similar problems and then translate the found solutions into the problem at hand. It is one of the most important skills in coding. Generative AI facilitates this process, and thus is a tool. Since R itself is a tool to help you learn and apply the material, I view using generative AI for help in specific coding tasks as a suitable use. You must, in all cases, understand what your code is doing, and be able to justify its use. If you cannot tell me, on review, what a line of code is used for, then you have not used generative AI properly.\n\rUsing generative AI to solve a complete problem set or problem set question beyond the mechanics and specifics of R coding is absolutely prohibited. Using generative AI to solve a problem verbatim without understanding the coding solution is absolutely prohibited. Violation of this policy is a violation of the Spartan Code of Honor and will result in immediate disciplinary action. See Academic honest above. I will not hesitate to file an academic dishonesty report.\n\r\r\rGrading\rAll grades are considered final. Any request for a re-grade beyond simple point-tallying mistakes will require that the entire assignment be re-graded. Any points previously awarded may be changed in either direction in the re-grade.\n\r\rResources\rMental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. Services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Counseling \u0026amp; Psychiatric Services (CAPS) website at www.caps.msu.edu.\n\rAccommodations\rIf you need a special accommodation for a disability, religious observance, or have any other concerns about your ability to perform well in this course, please contact me immediately so that we can discuss the issue and make appropriate arrangements. MSU has a specific policy for religious observance available here.\nMichigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation (“VISA”) form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (test, project, etc). Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible.\n\rCOVID-19\rThings are hard right now. You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities. You might be caring for extra people right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects.\nI’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified.\nIf you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Please contact me. I’m available at e-mail.\n\rMandated Reporting\rEssays, journals, and other materials submitted for this class are generally considered confidential pursuant to the University’s student record policies. However, students should be aware that University employees, including instructors, may not be able to maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues to protect the health and safety of MSU community members and others. As the instructor, I must report the following information to other University offices (including the Department of Police and Public Safety) if you share it with me:\r• Suspected child abuse/neglect, even if this maltreatment happened when you were a child;\r• Allegations of sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual harassment; and\r• Credible threats of harm to oneself or to others.\rThese reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In almost all cases, it will be your decision whether you wish to speak with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the MSU Counseling and Psychiatric Services.\n\rAcknowledgements\rThis syllabus and course structure was developed by Prof. Ben Bushong with iterative refinements by myself. All credit goes to Prof. Bushong. All errors are my own.\n\rMiscellanea\rAll class material will be posted on https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app. D2L will be used sparingly for submission of weekly writings and assignments and distribution of grades.\nUsing Office Hours\rPlease use my drop-in Office House Fridays 10:15 - 12:00 and by appointment. I will always stay from 10:15 to 11:00, but if nobody is present at 11:00, I will likely depart my office. If you wish to arrive after 11, just email me to let me know and I will be here.\nIt would be remarkable if you didn’t need some assistance with the material, and I am here to help. One of the benefits of open office hours is to accommodate many students at once; if fellow students are in my office, please join in and feel very free to show up in groups.\nAs a general rule, please first seek course-related help from the TA or my drop-in office hours. However, if my scheduled office hours are always infeasible for you, let me know, and then I may encourage you to make appointments with me. I ask that you schedule your studying so that you are prepared to ask questions during office hours – office hours are not a lecture and if you’re not prepared with questions we will end up awkwardly staring at each other for an hour until you leave.\nSome gentle requests regarding office hours and on contacting me. First, my office hours end sharply at the end, so don’t arrive 10 minutes before the scheduled end and expect a full session. Please arrive early if you have lengthy questions, or if you don’t want to risk not having time due to others’ questions. You are free to ask me some stuff by e-mail, (e.g. a typo or something on a handout), but please know e-mail sucks for answering many types of questions. “How do I do this lab?” or “What’s up with R?” are short questions with long answers. Come to office hours.\n\rContacting Me\rEmail is a blessing and a curse. Instant communication is wonderful, but often email is the wrong medium to have a productive conversation about course material. Moreover, I get a lot of emails. This means that I am frequently triaging emails into two piles: “my house is burning down” and “everything else”. Your email is unlikely to make the former pile. So… asking questions about course material is always best done in-class or in office hours. Students always roll their eyes when professors say things like that, but it’s true that if you have a question, it’s very likely someone else has the same question.\nThat said, email is still useful. If you’re going to use it, you should at least use if effectively. There’s a running joke in academia that professors only read an email until they find a question. They then respond to that question and ignore the rest of the email. I won’t do this, but I do think it is helpful to assume that the person on the receiving end of an email will operate this way. By keeping this in mind, you will write a much more concise and easy to understand email.\nSome general tips:\n\rAlways include [SSC442] in your subject line (brackets included).\rUse a short but informative subject line. For example: [SSC442] Final Project Grading\rUse your University-supplied email for University business. This helps me know who you are.\rOne topic, one email. If you have multiple things to discuss, and you anticipate followup replies, it is best to split them into two emails so that the threads do not get cluttered.\rAsk direct questions. If you’re asking multiple questions in one email, use a bulleted list.\rDon’t ask questions that are answered by reading the syllabus! This drives me nuts.\rI’ve also found that students are overly polite in emails. I suppose it may be intimidating to email a professor, and you should try to match the style that the professor prefers, but I view email for a course as a casual form of communication. Said another way: get to the point. Students often send an entire paragraph introducing themselves, but if you use your University email address, and add the course name in the subject, I will already know who you are. Here’s an example of a perfectly reasonable email:\r\r\rSubject: [SSC442] Lab, Question 2, Typo\nHi Prof. Kirkpatrick,\nThere seems to be a typo in the Lab on Question 2. The problem says to use a column of data that doesn’t seem to exist. Can you correct this or which should we use?\nThanks,\rStudent McStudentFace\n\r\rLetters of Recommendation / References\rIf you are applying for further study or another pursuit that requires letters of recommendation and you’d like me to recommend you, I will be glad to write a letter on your behalf if your final grade is a 4.0. Grades below a 4.0 may be handled on a case-by-case basis. In addition, you should have held at least three substantial conversations with me about the course material or other academic subjects over the course of the semester.\n\r\r\rBy the end of the course, you will realize that 1) I make many many many errors; 2) that I frequently cannot remember a command or the correct syntax; and 3) that none of this matters too much in the big picture because I know the broad approaches I’m trying to take and I know how to Google stuff. Learn from my idiocy.↩︎\n\rIf you’ve got money to burn, you can buy me a burrito.↩︎\n\rThis bothers me way more than it should.↩︎\n\rSo just don’t cheat or plagiarize.

Sometimes, we want to have one (or both) of our axes scaled non-linearly. For instance, if we wanted to have our x-axis be in log base 10, then each major tick would represent a factor of 10 over the last. This is not the default, so this change needs to be added through a scales layer. A quick look at the cheat sheet reveals the scale_x_continuous function lets us control the behavior of scales. We use them like this:\np + geom_point(size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +\rscale_x_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;log10\u0026quot;) +\rscale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;log10\u0026quot;)\rA couple of things here: adding things like scale_x_continuous(...) operates on the whole plot. In some cases, order matters, but it doesn’t here, so we can throw scale_x_continuous anywhere. Because we have altered the whole plot’s scale to be in the log-scale now, the nudge must be made smaller. It is in log-base-10 units. Using ?scale_x_continuous brings us to the help for both scale_x_continuous and scale_y_continuous, which shows us the options for transformations trans = ...\nThis particular transformation is so common that ggplot2 provides the specialized functions scale_x_log10 and scale_y_log10 which “inherit” (take the place of) the scale_x_continuous functions but have log base 10 as default. We can use these to rewrite the code like this:\np + geom_point(size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10()\rThis can make a plot much easier to read, though one has to be sure to pay attention to the values on the axes. Plotting anything with very large outliers will almost always be better if done in log-scale. Adding the scale layer is an easy way to fix this.\nWe can also use one of many built-in transformations. Of note: reverse just inverts the scale, which can be helpful, log uses the natural log, sqrt takes the square root (dropping anything with a negative value), reciprocal takes 1/x. If your x-axis is in a date format, you can also scale to hms (hour-minute-second) or date.\n\rTransforming data vs. transforming using scale_...\rWe could simply take the log of population and log of total in the call and we’d get something very similar. Note that we had to override the aesthetic mapping set in p in each of the geometries:\np + geom_point(aes(x = log(population, base=10), y = log(total, base=10)), size = 3) +\rgeom_text(aes(x = log(population, base=10), y = log(total, base=10)), nudge_x = 0.05) \rThis avoids using scale_x_continuous or it’s child function scale_x_log10. One advantage to using scale_x... is that the axes are correctly labeled. When we transform the data directly, the axis labels only show the transformed values, so 7,000,000 becomes 7.0. This could be confusing! We could update the axis labels to say “total murders (log base 10)” and “total population (log base 10)”, but that’s cumbersome. Using scale_x... is a lot more refined and easy.\n\r\rAxis labels, legends, and titles\rBut let’s say we did want to re-name our x-axis label. Or maybe we don’t like that the variable column name is lower-case “p”.\nAs with many things in ggplot, there are many ways to get the same result. We’ll go over one way of changing titles and labels, but know that there are many more.\nChanging axis titles\rWe’ll use the labs(...) annotation layer to do this, which is pretty straightforward. ?labs shows us what we can change, and while it looks pretty basic, the real meat is in the ... argument, which the help says is “A list of new name-value pairs”. This means we can re-define the label on anything that is an aesthetic mapping. X and Y are aesthetic mappings, so…\np + geom_point(size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10() + labs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;)\rNow, let’s use an aesthetic mapping that generates a legend, like color, and see what labs renames:\np + geom_point(aes(color = region), size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10() + labs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;US Region\u0026#39;)\rWe can rename the aesthetic mapping-relevant label using labs. Even if there are multiple mapped aesthetics:\np + geom_point(aes(color = region, size = total/population)) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10() + labs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;US Region\u0026#39;, size = \u0026#39;Murder rate\u0026#39;)\r\rTitles\rIn ?labs, we also see some things that look like titles and captions. We can include those:\np + geom_point(aes(color = region, size = total/population)) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10() + labs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;US Region\u0026#39;, size = \u0026#39;Murder rate\u0026#39;,\rtitle = \u0026#39;This is a title\u0026#39;, subtitle = \u0026#39;This is a subtitle\u0026#39;, caption = \u0026#39;This is a caption\u0026#39;, tag = \u0026#39;This is a tag\u0026#39;)\rNow that you know how, always label your plots with at least a title and have meaningful axis and legend labels.\n\r\rAxis ticks\rIn addition to the axis labels, we may want to format or change the axis tick labels (like “1e+06” above) or even where the tick marks and lines are drawn. If we don’t specify anything, the axis labels and tick marks are drawn as best as ggplot can do, but we can change this. This might be especially useful if our data has some meaningful cutoffs that aren’t found by the default, or we just don’t like where the marks fall or how they are labeled. This is easy to fix with ggplot.\nTo change the tick mark labels, we have to set the tick mark locations. Then we can set a label for each tick mark. Let’s go back to our murders data and, for simplicity, take the log transformation off the Y axis. We’ll use scale_y_continuous to tell R where to put the breaks (breaks =) and what to label the breaks. We have to give it one label for every break. Let’s say we just want a line at the 500’s and let’s say we want to (absurdly) use written numerics for each of the Y-axis lines. Since scale_y_log10 inherits from scale_y_continuous, we can just use that and add the breaks and labels:\np + geom_point(aes(color = region), size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = .05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10(breaks = c(0,50, 100, 500,1000,1500), labels = c(\u0026#39;Zero\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Fifty\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;One hundred\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Five hundred\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;One thousand\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Fifteen hundred\u0026#39;)) +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;US Region\u0026#39;)\rWe have manually set both the location and the label for the y-axis. Note that R filled in the in-between “minor” tick lines, but we can take those out. Since we are setting the location of the lines, we can do anything we want:\np + geom_point(aes(color = region), size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = .05) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10(breaks = c(0,50, 100, 721, 1000,1500), labels = c(\u0026#39;Zero\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Fifty\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;One hundred\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Seven hundred twenty one\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;One thousand\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Fifteen hundred\u0026#39;),\rminor_breaks = NULL) +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;US Region\u0026#39;)\rSo we can now define where axis tick lines should lie and how they should be labeled.\n\rAdditional geometries\rLet’s say we are happy with our axis tick locations, but we want to add a single additional line. Maybe we want to divide at 1,000,000 population (a vertical line at 1,000,000) becuase we think those over 1,000,000 are somehow different, and we want to call attention to the data around that point. As a more general example, if we were to plot, say, car accidents by age, we would maybe want to label age 21, when people can legally purchase alcohol (and subsequently cause car accidents).\nThis brings us to our first additional geometry beyond geom_point (OK, we used geom_text, but that’s more of an annotation). geom_vline lets us add a single vertical line (without aesthetic mappings). If we look at ?geom_vline we see that it requires ones aesthetic:xintercept. It also takes aesthetics like color and size, and introduces the linetype aesthetic:\np + geom_point(aes(color = region), size = 3) +\rgeom_text(nudge_x = .05) +\rgeom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1000000), col = \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, size = 2, linetype = 2) +\rscale_x_log10() +\rscale_y_log10(breaks = c(0,50, 100, 721, 1000,1500), labels = c(\u0026#39;Zero\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Fifty\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;One hundred\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Seven hundred twenty one\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;One thousand\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Fifteen hundred\u0026#39;),\rminor_breaks = NULL) +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Total murders\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;US Region\u0026#39;)\r## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\r## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\r## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.\r## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was\r## generated.\rCombining geometries is as easy as adding the layers with +.\ngeom_line\rFor a good old line plot, we use the line geometry at geom_line. The help for ?geom_line tells us that we need an x and a y aesthetic (much like geom_points). Since our murders data isn’t really suited to a line graph, we’ll use a daily stock price. We’ll get this using tidyquant, which pulls stock prices from Yahoo Finance and maintains the “tidy” format. You’ll need to install.packages('tidyquant') before you run this the first time.\nlibrary(tidyquant)\rAAPL = tq_get(\u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;, from = \u0026#39;2009-01-01\u0026#39;, to = \u0026#39;2021-08-01\u0026#39;, get = \u0026#39;stock.prices\u0026#39;)\rhead(AAPL)\r## # A tibble: 6 × 8\r## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 AAPL 2009-01-02 3.07 3.25 3.04 3.24 746015200 2.75\r## 2 AAPL 2009-01-05 3.33 3.43 3.31 3.38 1181608400 2.87\r## 3 AAPL 2009-01-06 3.43 3.47 3.30 3.32 1289310400 2.82\r## 4 AAPL 2009-01-07 3.28 3.30 3.22 3.25 753048800 2.76\r## 5 AAPL 2009-01-08 3.23 3.33 3.22 3.31 673500800 2.81\r## 6 AAPL 2009-01-09 3.33 3.34 3.22 3.23 546845600 2.75\rNow, we can plot a line graph of the Apple closing stock price over the requested date range. We want this to be a time series, so the x-axis will be the date and the y-axis will be the closing price.\nggplot(AAPL, aes(x = date, y = close)) +\rgeom_line() +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple stock price\u0026#39;)\rIn geom_line, R will automatically sort on the x-variable. If you don’t want this, then geom_path will use whatever order the data is in. Either way, if you have multiple observations for the same value on the x-axis, then you’ll get something pretty messy because R will try to connect, in some order, all the points. Let’s see an example with two stocks:\nAAPLNFLX = tq_get(c(\u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;NFLX\u0026quot;), from = \u0026#39;2021-01-01\u0026#39;, to = \u0026#39;2021-08-01\u0026#39;, get = \u0026#39;stock.prices\u0026#39;)\rggplot(AAPLNFLX, aes(x = date, y = close)) +\rgeom_line() +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple and Netflix stock price\u0026#39;)\rThat looks kinda strange. That’s because, for every date, we have two values - the NFLX and the AAPL value, so each day has a vertical line drawn between the two prices. This is nonsense, especially since what we want to see is the history of NFLX and AAPL over time.\nAesthetics to the rescue! Remember, when we use an aesthetic mapping, we are able to separate out data by things like color or linetype. Let’s use color as the aesthetic here, and map it to the stock ticker:\nAAPLNFLX = tq_get(c(\u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;NFLX\u0026quot;), from = \u0026#39;2021-01-01\u0026#39;, to = \u0026#39;2021-08-01\u0026#39;, get = \u0026#39;stock.prices\u0026#39;)\rggplot(AAPLNFLX, aes(x = date, y = close, color = symbol)) +\rgeom_line() +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple and Netflix stock price\u0026#39;)\rWell there we go! We can now see each stock price over time, with a convenient legend. Later on, we’ll learn how to change the color palatte. If we don’t necessarily want a different color but we do want to separate the lines, we can use the group aesthetic.\nAAPLNFLX = tq_get(c(\u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;NFLX\u0026quot;), from = \u0026#39;2021-01-01\u0026#39;, to = \u0026#39;2021-08-01\u0026#39;, get = \u0026#39;stock.prices\u0026#39;)\rggplot(AAPLNFLX, aes(x = date, y = close, group = symbol)) +\rgeom_line() + labs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple and Netflix stock price\u0026#39;)\rSimilar result as geom_line, but without the color difference (which makes it rather hard to tell what you’re looking at). But if we add labels using geom_label, we’ll get one label for every point, which will be overwhelming. The solution? Use some filtered data so that there is only one point for each label. But that means replacing the data in ggplot. Here’s how.\n\rUsing different data with different geometries\rJust as we can use different aesthetic mappings on each geometry, we can use different data entirely. This is useful when we want one geometry to have one set of data (like the stock prices above), but another geometry to only have a subset of the data. Why would we want that? Well, we’d like to label just one part of each of the lines in our plot, right? That means we want to label a subset of the stock data.\nTo replace data in a geometry, we just need to specify the data = argument separately:\nggplot(AAPLNFLX, aes(x = date, y = close, group = symbol)) +\rgeom_line() +\rgeom_label(data = AAPLNFLX %\u0026gt;% group_by(symbol) %\u0026gt;% slice(100),\raes(label = symbol),\rnudge_y = 20) + labs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple and Netflix stock price\u0026#39;)\rIn geom_label, we specified we wanted the 100th observation from each symbol to be the label location. Then, we nudged it up along y by 20 so that it’s clear of the line.\nR also has a very useful ggrepel package that gives us geom_label_repel which takes care of the nudging for us, even in complicated situations (lots of points, lines, etc.). It does a decent job here of moving the label to a point where it doesn’t cover a lot of data.\nlibrary(ggrepel)\rggplot(AAPLNFLX, aes(x = date, y = close, group = symbol)) +\rgeom_line() +\rgeom_label_repel(data = AAPLNFLX %\u0026gt;% group_by(symbol) %\u0026gt;% slice(100),\raes(label = symbol)) + labs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple and Netflix stock price\u0026#39;)\rNow, we don’t lose a lot of space to a legend, and we haven’t had to use color to separate the stock symbols.\n\rMultiple geometries\rSince this section is about adding geometries, we can combine points and lines. Since lines connect points, it will look like a giant connect-the-dots.\nlibrary(ggrepel)\rggplot(AAPLNFLX, aes(x = date, y = close, group = symbol)) +\rgeom_line() +\rgeom_point() + geom_label_repel(data = AAPLNFLX %\u0026gt;% group_by(symbol) %\u0026gt;% slice(100),\raes(label = symbol)) + labs(x = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Closing price\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Apple and Netflix stock price\u0026#39;)\r\r\rTry it!\rTRY IT\nStart by loading the dplyr and ggplot2 library as well as the murders and heights data.\nlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rdata(heights)\rdata(murders)\rWith ggplot2 plots can be saved as objects. For example we can associate a dataset with a plot object like this\r\rp \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = murders)\rBecause data is the first argument we don’t need to spell it out\np \u0026lt;- ggplot(murders)\rand we can also use the pipe:\np \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;% ggplot()\rWhat is class of the object p?\nRemember that to print an object you can use the command print or simply type the object.\rPrint the object p defined in exercise one and describe what you see.\r\rNothing happens.\rA blank slate plot.\rA scatterplot.\rA histogram.\r\rUsing the pipe %\u0026gt;%, create an object p but this time associated with the heights dataset instead of the murders dataset.\n\rWhat is the class of the object p you have just created?\n\rNow we are going to add a layer and the corresponding aesthetic mappings. For the murders data we plotted total murders versus population sizes. Explore the murders data frame to remind yourself what are the names for these two variables and select the correct answer. Hint: Look at ?murders.\n\r\rstate and abb.\rtotal_murders and population_size.\rtotal and population.\rmurders and size.\r\rTo create the scatterplot we add a layer with geom_point. The aesthetic mappings require us to define the x-axis and y-axis variables, respectively. So the code looks like this:\r\rmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = , y = )) +\rgeom_point()\rexcept we have to define the two variables x and y. Fill this out with the correct variable names.\nNote that if we don’t use argument names, we can obtain the same plot by making sure we enter the variable names in the right order like this:\r\rmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(population, total)) +\rgeom_point()\rRemake the plot but now with total in the x-axis and population in the y-axis.\nIf instead of points we want to add text, we can use the geom_text() or geom_label() geometries. The following code\r\rmurders %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(population, total)) + geom_label()\rwill give us the error message: Error: geom_label requires the following missing aesthetics: label\nWhy is this?\nWe need to map a character to each point through the label argument in aes.\rWe need to let geom_label know what character to use in the plot.\rThe geom_label geometry does not require x-axis and y-axis values.\rgeom_label is not a ggplot2 command.\r\rRewrite the code above to use abbreviation as the label through aes\n\rChange the color of the labels to blue. How will we do this?\n\r\rAdding a column called blue to murders.\rBecause each label needs a different color we map the colors through aes.\rUse the color argument in ggplot.\rBecause we want all colors to be blue, we do not need to map colors, just use the color argument in geom_label.\r\rRewrite the code above to make the labels blue.\n\rNow suppose we want to use color to represent the different regions. In this case which of the following is most appropriate:\n\r\rAdding a column called color to murders with the color we want to use.\rBecause each label needs a different color we map the colors through the color argument of aes .\rUse the color argument in ggplot.\rBecause we want all colors to be blue, we do not need to map colors, just use the color argument in geom_label.\r\rRewrite the code above to make the labels’ color be determined by the state’s region.\n\rNow we are going to change the x-axis to a log scale to account for the fact the distribution of population is skewed. Let’s start by defining an object p holding the plot we have made up to now\n\r\rp \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(population, total, label = abb, color = region)) +\rgeom_label()\rTo change the y-axis to a log scale we learned about the scale_x_log10() function. Add this layer to the object p to change the scale and render the plot.\nRepeat the previous exercise but now change both axes to be in the log scale.\n\rNow edit the code above to add the title “Gun murder data” to the plot. Hint: use the labs function or the ggtitle function.\n\r\r\r\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692645889,"objectID":"f4445f225dbc16ad343f16f0677c881d","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/content/02-content/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/02-content/","section":"content","summary":"Readings\r\rGuiding Questions\rStarting up\r\rScales and transformations\r\rLog transformations\rTransforming data vs. transforming using scale_...\r\rAxis labels, legends, and titles\r\rChanging axis titles\rTitles\r\rAxis ticks\rAdditional geometries\r\rgeom_line\rUsing different data with different geometries\rMultiple geometries\r\rTry it!\r\r\rReadings\r\rThis page.\r\rGuiding Questions\r\rNo guiding questions today as we’re mostly learning some technical aspects of ggplot\rWe have largely reversed our content and example lectures for data viz.","tags":null,"title":"Effective Visualizations","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r\rReadings\rGuiding Questions\rData visualization principles\r\rEncoding data using visual cues\rAvoid pseudo-three-dimensional plots\rAvoid too many significant digits\rKnow your audience\rKnow when to include 0\rDo not distort quantities\rOrder categories by a meaningful value\rShow the data\rFaceting\r\rUse common axes with facets\rAlign plots vertically to see horizontal changes and horizontally to see vertical changes\rFacet grids\rVisual cues to be compared should be adjacent, continued\rLeave some space\rUse color\r\rThink of the color blind\r\rUsing a discrete color palette\rUsing a continuous color palette\r\rgridExtra and grid.arrange\r\r\r\rReadings\r\rThis page.\r\r\rGuiding Questions\r\rWhy do we create visualizations?

Which of these are most frequently used? Why?\r\rAs with last week’s content, the technical aspects of this lecture will be explored in greater detail in the Thursday practical lecture. Today, we will focus on some principles.\n\r“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” – John Tukey\n\r\rData visualization principles\rWe have already provided some rules to follow as we created plots for our examples. Here, we aim to provide some general principles we can use as a guide for effective data visualization. Much of this section is based on a talk by Karl Broman1 titled “Creating Effective Figures and Tables”2 and includes some of the figures which were made with code that Karl makes available on his GitHub repository3, as well as class notes from Peter Aldhous’ Introduction to Data Visualization course4. Following Karl’s approach, we show some examples of plot styles we should avoid, explain how to improve them, and use these as motivation for a list of principles. We compare and contrast plots that follow these principles to those that don’t.\nThe principles are mostly based on research related to how humans detect patterns and make visual comparisons. The preferred approaches are those that best fit the way our brains process visual information. When deciding on a visualization approach, it is also important to keep our goal in mind. We may be comparing a viewable number of quantities, describing distributions for categories or numeric values, comparing the data from two groups, or describing the relationship between two variables. As a final note, we want to emphasize that for a data scientist it is important to adapt and optimize graphs to the audience. For example, an exploratory plot made for ourselves will be different than a chart intended to communicate a finding to a general audience.\nAs with the discussion above, we will be using these libraries—note the addition of gridExtra:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(dslabs)\rlibrary(gridExtra)\rEncoding data using visual cues\rVisual cues are any element of design that gives the viewer clues as to how to use the object. For instance, we can look at door handles like these\nand know exactly what to do with them. We don’t even need the “PUSH” and “PULL” – approaching just the pull handle in the wild gives sufficient visual cues that you know the door is a “pull” door. Encountering a metal plate with no handle is going to imply “push”. If the door on the right were a “push” door, you’d be momentarily confused! It’s poor design. Your plots should use visual cues to help readers understand how to use them with no confusion.\nWe start by describing some principles for encoding data. There are several approaches at our disposal including position, aligned lengths, angles, area, brightness, and color hue.\nTo illustrate how some of these strategies compare, let’s suppose we want to report the results from two hypothetical polls regarding browser preference taken in 2000 and then 2015. For each year, we are simply comparing five quantities – the five percentages. A widely used graphical representation of percentages, popularized by Microsoft Excel, is the pie chart:\nHere we are representing quantities with both areas and angles, since both the angle and area of each pie slice are proportional to the quantity the slice represents. This turns out to be a sub-optimal choice since, as demonstrated by perception studies, humans are not good at precisely quantifying angles and are even worse when area is the only available visual cue. The donut chart is an example of a plot that uses only area:\nTo see how hard it is to quantify angles and area, note that the rankings and all the percentages in the plots above changed from 2000 to 2015. Can you determine the actual percentages and rank the browsers’ popularity? Can you see how the percentages changed from 2000 to 2015? It is not easy to tell from the plot. In fact, the pie R function help file states that:\n\rPie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data.\n\rIn this case, simply showing the numbers is not only clearer, but would also save on printing costs if printing a paper copy:\n\r\rBrowser\r\r2000\r\r2015\r\r\r\r\r\rOpera\r\r3\r\r2\r\r\r\rSafari\r\r21\r\r22\r\r\r\rFirefox\r\r23\r\r21\r\r\r\rChrome\r\r26\r\r29\r\r\r\rIE\r\r28\r\r27\r\r\r\r\rThe preferred way to plot these quantities is to use length and position as visual cues, since humans are much better at judging linear measures. The barplot uses this approach by using bars of length proportional to the quantities of interest. By adding horizontal lines at strategically chosen values, in this case at every multiple of 10, we ease the visual burden of quantifying through the position of the top of the bars. Compare and contrast the information we can extract from the two figures.\nNotice how much easier it is to see the differences in the barplot. In fact, we can now determine the actual percentages by following a horizontal line to the x-axis.\nIf for some reason you need to make a pie chart, label each pie slice with its respective percentage so viewers do not have to infer them from the angles or area:\nIn general, when displaying quantities, position and length are preferred over angles and/or area. Brightness and color are even harder to quantify than angles. But, as we will see later, they are sometimes useful when more than two dimensions must be displayed at once.\n\rAvoid pseudo-three-dimensional plots\rThe figure below, taken from the scientific literature5,\rshows three variables: dose, drug type and survival. Although your screen/book page is flat and two-dimensional, the plot tries to imitate three dimensions and assigned a dimension to each variable.\n(Image courtesy of Karl Broman)\nHumans are not good at seeing in three dimensions (which explains why it is hard to parallel park) and our limitation is even worse with regard to pseudo-three-dimensions. To see this, try to determine the values of the survival variable in the plot above. Can you tell when the purple ribbon intersects the red one? This is an example in which we can easily use color to represent the categorical variable instead of using a pseudo-3D:\n##First read data\rurl \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/raw/master/R/fig8dat.csv\u0026quot;\rdat \u0026lt;- read.csv(url)\r##Now make alternative plot\rdat %\u0026gt;% gather(drug, survival, -log.dose) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(drug = gsub(\u0026quot;Drug.\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,drug)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(log.dose, survival, color = drug)) +\rgeom_line()\rNotice how much easier it is to determine the survival values.\nPseudo-3D is sometimes used completely gratuitously: plots are made to look 3D even when the 3rd dimension does not represent a quantity. This only adds confusion and makes it harder to relay your message. Here are two examples:\n(Images courtesy of Karl Broman)\n\rAvoid too many significant digits\rBy default, statistical software like R returns many significant digits. The default behavior in R is to show 7 significant digits. That many digits often adds no information and the added visual clutter can make it hard for the viewer to understand the message. As an example, here are the per 10,000 disease rates, computed from totals and population in R, for California across the five decades:\n\r\rstate\r\ryear\r\rMeasles\r\rPertussis\r\rPolio\r\r\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1940\r\r37.8826320\r\r18.3397861\r\r0.8266512\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1950\r\r13.9124205\r\r4.7467350\r\r1.9742639\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1960\r\r14.1386471\r\rNA\r\r0.2640419\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1970\r\r0.9767889\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1980\r\r0.3743467\r\r0.0515466\r\rNA\r\r\r\r\rWe are reporting precision up to 0.00001 cases per 10,000, a very small value in the context of the changes that are occurring across the dates. In this case, two significant figures is more than enough and clearly makes the point that rates are decreasing:\n\r\rstate\r\ryear\r\rMeasles\r\rPertussis\r\rPolio\r\r\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1940\r\r37.9\r\r18.3\r\r0.8\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1950\r\r13.9\r\r4.7\r\r2.0\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1960\r\r14.1\r\rNA\r\r0.3\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1970\r\r1.0\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\r1980\r\r0.4\r\r0.1\r\rNA\r\r\r\r\rUseful ways to change the number of significant digits or to round numbers are signif and round. You can define the number of significant digits globally by setting options like this: options(digits = 3).\nAnother principle related to displaying tables is to place values being compared on columns rather than rows. Note that our table above is easier to read than this one:\n\r\rstate\r\rdisease\r\r1940\r\r1950\r\r1960\r\r1970\r\r1980\r\r\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\rMeasles\r\r37.9\r\r13.9\r\r14.1\r\r1\r\r0.4\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\rPertussis\r\r18.3\r\r4.7\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.1\r\r\r\rCalifornia\r\rPolio\r\r0.8\r\r2.0\r\r0.3\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r\r\r\r\rKnow your audience\rGraphs can be used for 1) our own exploratory data analysis, 2) to convey a message to experts, or 3) to help tell a story to a general audience. Make sure that the intended audience understands each element of the plot.\nAs a simple example, consider that for your own exploration it may be more useful to log-transform data and then plot it. However, for a general audience that is unfamiliar with converting logged values back to the original measurements, using a log-scale for the axis instead of log-transformed values will be much easier to digest.\n\rKnow when to include 0\rWhen using barplots, it is misinformative not to start the bars at 0. This is because, by using a barplot, we are implying the length is proportional to the quantities being displayed. By avoiding 0, relatively small differences can be made to look much bigger than they actually are. This approach is often used by politicians or media organizations trying to exaggerate a difference. Below is an illustrative example used by Peter Aldhous in this lecture: http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html.\n(Source: Fox News, via Media Matters6.)\nFrom the plot above, it appears that apprehensions have almost tripled when, in fact, they have only increased by about 16%. Starting the graph at 0 illustrates this clearly:\nHere is another example, described in detail in a Flowing Data blog post:\r(Source: Fox News, via Flowing Data7.)\nThis plot makes a 13% increase look like a five fold change. Here is the appropriate plot:\nFinally, here is an extreme example that makes a very small difference of under 2% look like a 10-100 fold change:\r(Source:\rVenezolana de Televisión via Pakistan Today8 and Diego Mariano.)\nHere is the appropriate plot:\nWhen using position rather than length, it is then not necessary to include 0. This is particularly the case when we want to compare differences between groups relative to the within-group variability. Here is an illustrative example showing country average life expectancy stratified across continents in 2012:\nNote that in the plot on the left, which includes 0, the space between 0 and 43 adds no information and makes it harder to compare the between and within group variability.\n\rDo not distort quantities\rDuring President Barack Obama’s 2011 State of the Union Address, the following chart was used to compare the US GDP to the GDP of four competing nations:\r(Source: The 2011 State of the Union Address9)\nJudging by the area of the circles, the US appears to have an economy over five times larger than China’s and over 30 times larger than France’s. However, if we look at the actual numbers, we see that this is not the case. The actual ratios are 2.6 and 5.8 times bigger than China and France, respectively. The reason for this distortion is that the radius, rather than the area, was made to be proportional to the quantity, which implies that the proportion between the areas is squared: 2.6 turns into 6.5 and 5.8 turns into 34.1. Here is a comparison of the circles we get if we make the value proportional to the radius and to the area:\ngdp \u0026lt;- c(14.6, 5.7, 5.3, 3.3, 2.5)\rgdp_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(Country = rep(c(\u0026quot;United States\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;China\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Japan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Germany\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;France\u0026quot;),2),\ry = factor(rep(c(\u0026quot;Radius\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Area\u0026quot;),each=5), levels = c(\u0026quot;Radius\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Area\u0026quot;)),\rGDP= c(gdp^2/min(gdp^2), gdp/min(gdp))) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(Country = reorder(Country, GDP))\rgdp_data %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(Country, y, size = GDP)) +\rgeom_point(show.legend = FALSE, color = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;) +\rscale_size(range = c(2,25)) +\rcoord_flip() + ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # identical to labs(y = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)\rNot surprisingly, ggplot2 defaults to using area rather than\rradius. Of course, in this case, we really should not be using area at all since we can use position and length:\ngdp_data %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(y == \u0026quot;Area\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(Country, GDP)) +\rgeom_bar(stat = \u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;, width = 0.5) +\rlabs(y = \u0026quot;GDP in trillions of US dollars\u0026quot;)\r\rOrder categories by a meaningful value\rWhen one of the axes is used to show categories, as is done in barplots, the default ggplot2 behavior is to order the categories alphabetically when they are defined by character strings. If they are defined by factors, they are ordered by the factor levels. We rarely want to use alphabetical order. Instead, we should order by a meaningful quantity. In all the cases above, the barplots were ordered by the values being displayed. The exception was the graph showing barplots comparing browsers. In this case, we kept the order the same across the barplots to ease the comparison. Specifically, instead of ordering the browsers separately in the two years, we ordered both years by the average value of 2000 and 2015.\nWe previously learned how to use the reorder function, which helps us achieve this goal.\rTo appreciate how the right order can help convey a message, suppose we want to create a plot to compare the murder rate across states. We are particularly interested in the most dangerous and safest states. Note the difference when we order alphabetically (the default) versus when we order by the actual rate:\ndata(murders)\rp1 \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = state, y = murder_rate)) +\rgeom_bar(stat=\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;) +\rcoord_flip() +\rtheme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)\rp2 \u0026lt;- murders %\u0026gt;% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(state = reorder(state, murder_rate)) %\u0026gt;% # here\u0026#39;s the magic!\rggplot(aes(x = state, y = murder_rate)) +\rgeom_bar(stat=\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;) +\rcoord_flip() +\rtheme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)\rgrid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2) # we\u0026#39;ll cover this later\rWe can make the second plot like this:\nThe reorder function lets us reorder groups as well. Earlier we saw an example related to income distributions across regions. Here are the two versions plotted against each other:\nThe first orders the regions alphabetically, while the second orders them by the group’s median.\n\rShow the data\rWe have focused on displaying single quantities across categories. We now shift our attention to displaying data, with a focus on comparing groups.\nTo motivate our first principle, “show the data”, we go back to our artificial example of describing heights to a person who is unaware of some basic facts about the population of interest (and is otherwise unsophisticated). This time let’s assume that this person is interested in the difference in heights between males and females. A commonly seen plot used for comparisons between groups, popularized by software such as Microsoft Excel, is the dynamite plot, which shows the average and standard errors.10 The plot looks like this:\nThe average of each group is represented by the top of each bar and the antennae extend out from the average to the average plus two standard errors. If all ET receives is this plot, he will have little information on what to expect if he meets a group of human males and females. The bars go to 0: does this mean there are tiny humans measuring less than one foot? Are all males taller than the tallest females? Is there a range of heights? ET can’t answer these questions since we have provided almost no information on the height distribution.\nThis brings us to our first principle: show the data. This simple ggplot2 code already generates a more informative plot than the barplot by simply showing all the data points:\nFor example, this plot gives us an idea of the range of the data. However, this plot has limitations as well, since we can’t really see all the 238 and 812 points plotted for females and males, respectively, and many points are plotted on top of each other. As we have previously described, visualizing the distribution is much more informative. But before doing this, we point out two ways we can improve a plot showing all the points.\nThe first is to add jitter, which adds a small random shift to each point. In this case, adding horizontal jitter does not alter the interpretation, since the point heights do not change, but we minimize the number of points that fall on top of each other and, therefore, get a better visual sense of how the data is distributed. A second improvement comes from using alpha blending: making the points somewhat transparent. The more points fall on top of each other, the darker the plot, which also helps us get a sense of how the points are distributed. Here is the same plot with jitter and alpha blending:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(sex, height)) +\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2)\rNow we start getting a sense that, on average, males are taller than females. We also note dark horizontal bands of points, demonstrating that many report values that are rounded to the nearest integer.\n\rFaceting\rLooking at the previous plot, it’s easy to tell that males tend to be taller than females. Before, we showed how we can plot two distributions over each other using an aesthetic mapping. Something like this:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height, fill = sex)) +\rgeom_histogram(alpha = .5, show.legend = TRUE) +\rlabs(fill = \u0026#39;Sex\u0026#39;)\rSometimes, putting the plots on top of each other, even with a well-chosen alpha, does not clearly communicate the differences in the distribution. When we want to compare side-by-side, we will often use facets. Facets are a bit like supercharged aesthetic mapping because they let us separate plots based on categorical variables, but instead of putting them together, we can have side-by-side plots.\nTwo functions in ggplot give facets: facet_wrap and facet_grid. We’ll use facet_grid as this is a little more powerful.\nFacets are added as an additional layer like this: + facet_grid(. ~ sex). Inside the function, we have a “formula” that is written without quotes (which is unusual for R). Since facet_grid takes a “formula”, all we have to do to facet is decide how we want to lay out our plots. If we want each of the faceting groups to lie along the vertical axis, we put the variable on which we want to facet before the “~”, and after the “~” we simply put a period. If we want the groups to lie along the horizontal axis, we put the variable after the “~” and the period before. In the example, we’ll separate the histogram by drawing them side by side along the horizontal axis.\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_grid(.~sex)\rThis would be the result if we took the females, plotted the histogram, then took the males, made another histogram, and then put them side by side. But we do it in one command by adding +facet_grid(...)\nUse common axes with facets\rSince we have plots side-by-side, they can have different scales along the x-axis (or along the y-axis if we were stacking with sex ~ .). We want to be careful here - if we don’t have matching scales on these axes, then it’ll be really hard to visually see differences in the distribution.\nAs an example of what not to do, and to show that we can use the scales argument in facet_grid, we can allow the x-axis to freely scale between the plots. This makes it hard to tell that males are, on average, taller because the average male height, despite being larger than the average female height (70 vs. 65 or so) falls in the same location within the plot box. Note that 80 is the extreme edge for the left plot, but not in the right plot.\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_grid(. ~ sex, scales = \u0026quot;free_x\u0026quot;)\r\rAlign plots vertically to see horizontal changes and horizontally to see vertical changes\rIn these histograms, the visual cue related to decreases or increases in height are shifts to the left or right, respectively: horizontal changes. Aligning the plots vertically helps us see this change when the axes are fixed:\nheights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_grid(. ~ sex)\rThis plot makes it much easier to notice that men’s heights are, on average, higher.\nThe sample size of females is smaller than of males – that is, we have more males in the data. Try table(heights$sex) to see this. It’s also clear from the above plot because the height of the bars on the y-axis (count) are smaller for females. If we are interested in the distribution within our sample, this is useful. If we’re interested in the distribution of females vs. the distribution of males, we might want to re-scale the y-axis. Here we use scales = 'free_y' to allow each of the y-axes to have their own scale. Pay close attention to the axis labels now!\np2 \u0026lt;- heights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(height)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_grid(sex~., scales = \u0026#39;free_y\u0026#39;)\rp2\rWe still have count on the y-axis, so we didn’t switch to density (though it would look the same). Instead, we rescaled the y-axis, which gives us a different perspective but still contains the count information.\nIf we want the more compact summary provided by boxplots, we then align them horizontally since, by default, boxplots move up and down with changes in height. Following our show the data principle, we then overlay all the data points:\np3=heights %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(sex, height)) +\rgeom_boxplot(coef=3) +\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Height in inches\u0026quot;)\rp3\rNow contrast and compare these three plots, based on exactly the same data:\nNotice how much more we learn from the two plots on the right. Barplots are useful for showing one number, but not very useful when we want to describe distributions.\n\rFacet grids\rAs the name implies, facet_grid can make more than just side-by-plots. If we specify variables on boths sides of the “~”, we get a grid of plots.\ngapminder::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year %in% c(1952,1972, 1992, 2002)) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(continent != \u0026#39;Oceania\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_density() +\rfacet_grid(continent ~ year)\rThis makes it easy to read the life expectancy distribution over time (left-to-right) and across continents (up-and-down). It makes it easy to see that Africa has spread it’s life expectancy distribution (some improved, some didn’t), while Europe has become more clustered at the top end over time. Faceting in a grid is very helpful when you have a time dimension.\n\rVisual cues to be compared should be adjacent, continued\rFor each continent, let’s compare income in 1970 versus 2010. When comparing income data across regions between 1970 and 2010, we made a figure similar to the one below, but this time we investigate continents rather than regions.\nNote that there are two gapminder datasets, one in dslabs and one in the gapminder package. The dslabs version has more data, so I will switch to that here by using dslabs::gapminder as our data.\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) \u0026amp; !is.na(gdp)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(labels = paste(year, continent)) %\u0026gt;% # creating text labels\rggplot(aes(x = labels, y = dollars_per_day)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rtheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.25)) +\rscale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;log2\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Income in dollars per day\u0026quot;)\rThe default in ggplot2 is to order labels alphabetically so the labels with 1970 come before the labels with 2010, making the comparisons challenging because a continent’s distribution in 1970 is visually far from its distribution in 2010. It is much easier to make the comparison between 1970 and 2010 for each continent when the boxplots for that continent are next to each other:\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) \u0026amp; !is.na(gdp)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(labels = paste(continent, year)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(labels, dollars_per_day)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rtheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .25)) +\rscale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;log2\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Income in dollars per day\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026#39;Continent and Year\u0026#39;) \r\rLeave some space\rThe design maven Edward Tufte emphasizes th eneed for clarifying and empty space. Resist the urge to pack everything into a small layout. Especially in digital formats, space can be inexpensive, and can help attract the eye to your work.\nWe can control the space around our plots using the theme() function. We’ll cover more details of theme() on Thursday. To add some space around a plot, we use theme(plot.margin = margin(t=2, r = 2, b = 2, l = 2, unit = 'cm')), where the arguments correspond to top, right, bottom, left (in that order). I’m also going to add a black border to the outside so that we can see the boundary of the frame.\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) \u0026amp; !is.na(gdp)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(labels = paste(continent, year)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(labels, dollars_per_day)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rtheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .25)) +\rscale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;log2\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Income in dollars per day\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026#39;Continent and Year\u0026#39;) +\rtheme(plot.margin = margin(t=2, r = 2, b = 2, l = 2, unit = \u0026#39;cm\u0026#39;),\rplot.background = element_rect(color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, size = 1)) # Adds black border\r\rUse color\rThe comparison becomes even easier to make if we use color to denote the two things we want to compare. Now we do not have to make the labels column and can just use continent on the x-axis:\n\r\rThink of the color blind\rAbout 10% of the population is color blind. Unfortunately, the default colors used in ggplot2 are not optimal for this group. However, ggplot2 does make it easy to change the color palette used in the plots. An example of how we can use a color blind friendly palette is described here: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#a-colorblind-friendly-palette:\ncolor_blind_friendly_cols \u0026lt;-\rc(\u0026quot;#999999\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#E69F00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#56B4E9\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#009E73\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;#F0E442\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#0072B2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#D55E00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#CC79A7\u0026quot;)\rHere are the colors\rFrom Seafood Prices Reveal Impacts of a Major Ecological Disturbance:\rThere are several resources that can help you select colors, for example this one: http://bconnelly.net/2013/10/creating-colorblind-friendly-figures/.\nUsing a discrete color palette\rIf you’re simply trying to differentiate between groups by using color, there are many ways of changing your color palette in ggplot. Most use scale_fill_discrete or scale_color_discrete (depending on the aesthetic for which you’re setting the color).\nThe easiest way of getting good-looking (e.g. non-default) colors is the scale_fill_viridis_d function, which “inherits” (takes the place of and has the properties of) scale_fill_discrete. Viridis has four color palettes and each is designed to be used to maximize the differentiation between colors.\nWe will subset our dslabs::gapminder dataset to five different years and take a look at what Viridis colors can do across those five:\ngp = dslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;% filter(year == 1990 | year == 1995 | year==2000 | year == 2005 | year==2010 ) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdp/population, fill = as.factor(year))) + coord_flip()\rgp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Default\u0026#39;)\rThe default uses five different colors plucked seemingly at random. They are actually drawn from a palette of default ggplot colors.\nLet’s try Viridis\ngp = dslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;% filter(year == 1990 | year == 1995 | year==2000 | year == 2005 | year==2010 ) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdp/population, fill = as.factor(year))) + coord_flip() + labs(fill = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;)\rviridis_a = gp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Viridis A\u0026#39;) + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;)\rviridis_b = gp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Viridis B\u0026#39;) + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;)\rviridis_c = gp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Viridis C\u0026#39;) + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;)\rviridis_d = gp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Viridis D\u0026#39;) + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \u0026#39;D\u0026#39;)\rgrid.arrange(viridis_a, viridis_b, viridis_c, viridis_d)\rViridis uses a better palette of colors that, though distinct, have some cohesiveness to them.\nWe can also use a custom palette, like the colorblind palette from before (see above where we defined color_blind_friendly_cols). We just need to use the type= argument and give ggplot our color-blind friendly palette of colors. If the palette has more entries than we have (N) distinct categories, R reverts to the default.\ngp = dslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;% filter(year == 1990 | year == 1995 | year==2000 | year == 2005 | year==2010 ) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdp/population, fill = as.factor(year))) + coord_flip() + labs(fill = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;) custom_a = gp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Viridis A\u0026#39;) + scale_fill_discrete(type = color_blind_friendly_cols)\rcustom_b = gp + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \u0026#39;Viridis A\u0026#39;) + scale_fill_discrete(type = color_blind_friendly_cols[1:3])\rgrid.arrange(custom_a, custom_b)\rIn the lower plot, we only give it a length-3 vector of colors, and it needs 5, so it returns to default. Unfortunately, it doesn’t warn you as to this behavior. Bad R!\n\rUsing a continuous color palette\rWe may often want to use the color to indicate a numeric value instead of simply using it to delineate groupings. When this is the case, the fill or color aesthetic is set to a continuous value. For instance, if one were to plot election results by precinct, we may represent precincts with heavy Republican support as dark red, swing districts as purple or white, and Democratic districts as blue. The intensity of red/blue indicates how heavily slanted votes in that precinct were in the election. This is known as a color ramp.\nLets plot one country’s GDP by year, but have the color indicate the life expectancy. Whenever you map a continuous variable to a color or fill aesthetic, you get the default color ramp – dark-to-light blue:\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(country==\u0026#39;Romania\u0026#39; \u0026amp; year\u0026gt;1980) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp/population, color = life_expectancy)) + geom_point(size = 5) +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;GDP Per Capita\u0026#39;, fill = \u0026#39;Life Expectancy\u0026#39;)\rWe can see that GDP per capita went up, then down in 1989 (fall of the Soviet Union), then up after that. The color ramp tells us that life expectancy reached 75 years near the end, and it certainly improved in the post-2000 era.\nWe can set some of the points on the ramp manually - here, the ramp starts at dark blue and ends at light blue, but what if we wanted to start at red, and at blue, and cross white in the middle? Easy! We use scale_color_gradient2 and specify the colors for low, mid, and high, and specify the midpoint at 72.5 years.\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(country==\u0026#39;Romania\u0026#39; \u0026amp; year\u0026gt;1980) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp/population, color = life_expectancy)) + scale_color_gradient2(low = \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, mid = \u0026#39;white\u0026#39;, high = \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, midpoint = 72.5) + geom_point(size = 5) +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;GDP Per Capita\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;Life Expectancy\u0026#39;)\rThe midpoint specification is extra useful when there is a threshold (like 50% of the vote) that indicates a different qualitative outcome.\nThe gradient2 method does not always work with the colorblind discrete palette - the colors interpolated may be in the range in which colorblindness tends to be a problem:\ndslabs::gapminder %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(country==\u0026#39;Romania\u0026#39; \u0026amp; year\u0026gt;1980) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp/population, color = life_expectancy)) + scale_color_gradient2(low = color_blind_friendly_cols[3], mid = color_blind_friendly_cols[4], high = color_blind_friendly_cols[5], midpoint = 72.5) + geom_point(size = 5) +\rlabs(x = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;GDP Per Capita\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;Life Expectancy\u0026#39;)\r\r\rgridExtra and grid.arrange\rThe gridExtra package has been used a few times in this lesson to combine plots using the grid.arrange function. The use is pretty intuitive - you save your plots as objects plot1 \u0026lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x = var1)) and plot2 \u0026lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x = var2)), and then use grid.arrange(plot1, plot2) to combine. The function will align as best it can, and there are more advanced grob-based functions that can adjust and align axes between plots, but we won’t get into them. If we want to set the layout, we can specify nrow and ncol to set the rows and columns.\nThe very-useful patchwork package is quickly replacing grid.arrange and provides more flexibility.\n\r\r\rhttp://kbroman.org/↩︎\n\rhttps://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2017.pdf↩︎\n\rhttps://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs↩︎\n\rhttp://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/index.html↩︎\n\rhttps://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1177010488↩︎\n\rhttp://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/04/05/fox-news-newest-dishonest-chart-immigration-enf/193507↩︎\n\rhttp://flowingdata.com/2012/08/06/fox-news-continues-charting-excellence/↩︎\n\rhttps://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/18/whats-at-stake-in-venezuelan-presidential-vote↩︎\n\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl2g40GoRxg↩︎\n\rIf you’re unfamiliar, standard errors are defined later in the course—do not confuse them with the standard deviation of the data.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692645889,"objectID":"267a7446c3b4fe31bb41b58ba3b49b11","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/content/03-content/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/03-content/","section":"content","summary":"Readings\rGuiding Questions\rData visualization principles\r\rEncoding data using visual cues\rAvoid pseudo-three-dimensional plots\rAvoid too many significant digits\rKnow your audience\rKnow when to include 0\rDo not distort quantities\rOrder categories by a meaningful value\rShow the data\rFaceting\r\rUse common axes with facets\rAlign plots vertically to see horizontal changes and horizontally to see vertical changes\rFacet grids\rVisual cues to be compared should be adjacent, continued\rLeave some space\rUse color\r\rThink of the color blind\r\rUsing a discrete color palette\rUsing a continuous color palette\r\rgridExtra and grid.","tags":null,"title":"Visualizations in Practice","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rBelow is a roadmap for the semester. Note that this will inevitably change from the first day you access this course. However, whatever is listed below should be considered canon. Accordingly, you should visit this page frequently throughout the term.\nAs mentioned in the syllabus, the course is structured by topics; each week introduces a new topic. Moreover, every week is divided into three important sections that you should engage with.\nOverview\rThe class is structured with three distinct bits. First, the Tuesday lecture will give an overview of the topic for the week. Next, the Thursday lecture will have a short, practical lecture and an activity which is designed to give you hands-on experience and a greater understanding of the broader material. Finally, you will complete weekly writings (short) and labs (also somewhat short; requiring coding in R). Out of class, you will complete readings and complete assignments.\n\rContent (): This page contains the readings for the topic. These pages should be read completely. Lectures are not an exact replication of the written content; on the contrary, the lectures are intended to keep you focused on the high-level ideas, while the readings are broader and more comprehensive. Accordingly, lectures are shorter than the (often quite lengthy) written content.\n\rExamples (): This page the material that we will discuss in Thursday classes. In addition to teaching specific content, there are many more R code examples. These are intended as a useful reference to various functions that you will need when working on (nearly) weekly labs and your group project.\n\rAssignments (): This page contains the instructions for the weekly lab (1–3 brief tasks) and for the two mini projects + final project. Labs are due by 11:59 PM (Eastern) on the Monday after they’re posted. Labs are in addition to weekly writings and projects.\n\r\r\rOffice Hours (TA) Monday 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm and Friday 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm via Zoom passcode: SSC442\rThe teaching assistant for this course (Sam Tucker; tucke130@msu.edu) will host office hours each week to help promote additional understanding. I highly encourage you to utilize this resource, especially if you struggle with basic R programming.\n\rProf. K’s Office Hours Wednesdays 2:15 pm to 3:15 pm via Zoom passcode: DATA\rNote that I moved my OH back by 15 mins. I will hold weekly Zoom drop-in office hours on Wednesdays from 2:15-3:15pm and via appointment (just ask!). I will be in the Zoom Room from 2:15-3:15 pm, but will stay later if and only if someone is there or you have emailed me beforehand to let me know you’re planning on coming later. Drop-in office hours are time set aside for you to ask questions about the material, the course, the topic, or about life in general. They are a great resource and most faculty are bewildered when students don’t use them.\nAll office hours are via Zoom as questions will often (but don’t always) center around coding and sharing a screen in Zoom is pretty easy. Both the TA and Prof. K will monitor the course slack for questions as well.\ntl;dr: You should follow this general process (in order) each week:\n\rDo everything on the content () page before Tuesday\rCome to the lecture on Tuesday.\rWhile “in class” on Thursday, work through the example () page\rComplete the weekly writing by Saturday - topic assigned in class, see assignments for details and template\rComplete the lab () by Monday.\rAs needed, attend the lab hours hosted by the TA.\r\r\r\r\r\rProgramming Foundations\rContent\rExample\rAssignment\r\r\rWeek 0 (Aug 29 / Sep 1)\r(Re-) Introduction to R\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 1 (Sep 5/7)\rProgramming Basics, the tidyverse, and Visualization\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 2 (Sep 12/14)\rVisualization II\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 3 (Sep 19/21)\rVisualization III\r\r\r\r\r\r\rData Analysis Foundations\rContent\rExample\rAssignment\r\r\rWeek 4 (Sep 26/28)\rUncertainty and Probability in R\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 5 (Oct 3/5)\rLinear Regression I\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 6 (Oct 10/12)\rLinear Regression II\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSaturday Oct 14th\r Project 1 Due\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 7 (Oct 17/19)\rLinear Regression III\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rApplications of Data Analysis\rContent\rExample\rAssignment\r\r\rWeek 8 (Oct !24/27)\rLASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 9 (Oct 31 / Nov 2)\rNonlinear Regression\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 10 (Nov 7/11)\rBias vs Variance (No lab this week)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 11 (Nov 14/16)\rClassification\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSaturday Nov 18th\r Project 2 Due\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rFurther Extensions\rContent\rExample\rAssignment\r\r\rWeek 12 (Nov 21/!23)\rText as Data\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 13 (Nov 28/30)\rWrangling Data\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWeek 14 (Dec 5/7)\rGeospatial in R (Last lab)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rConclusions\rContent\rExample\rAssignment\r\r\rThursday Dec 14th, 11:59pm\r Final Project Due\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667415582,"objectID":"3e223d7ba58b0122b42458e4cf52e04c","permalink":"https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/schedule/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/schedule/","section":"","summary":"Below is a roadmap for the semester.
