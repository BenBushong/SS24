## Insert prompt here

Write your text here. 250 words is around 1/2 page when rendered.

Update the Title and Author, above (no credit if your name isn't on it!).

Save the .rmd to your `weekly writing` folder on your hard drive, then click "knit" to render a .pdf

Turn in the .pdf, not this template.

You can delete the code chunk below if your weekly writing doesn't have any coding in it.

```{r ifYouHaveCode}
print('No code in this weekly writing')
```
