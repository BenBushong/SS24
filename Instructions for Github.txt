Use the FS20.rproj, which opens as SSC442_SS21 in R.

Netlify is set to point to ajkirkpatrick/FS20 using the Spring2021 branch.

The origin in GitHub in Rstudio points to MSUDataAnalytics/FS20, so pushing directly will create a Spring2021 branch on Ben's repository.
The remote "AJK" points ot my ajkirkpatrick/FS20, so the Spring2021 branch there will be what Netlify builds from.

Change the branch to AJK>Spring2021 to update
