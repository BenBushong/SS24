Use the FS20.rproj, which opens as SSC442_SS21 in R.

Netlify is set to point to ajkirkpatrick/FS20 using the Spring2021 branch (can update if necessary)

The origin in GitHub in Rstudio points to MSUDataAnalytics/FS20, so pushing directly will create a Spring2021 branch on Ben's repository.
The remote "AJK" points ot my ajkirkpatrick/FS20, so the Spring2021 branch there will be what Netlify builds from.

To update MY FS20>Spring2021, make sure you are on the Spring2021 branch, then use terminal:

			git push AJK

This will push to my copy of Spring2021 and WILL NOT add the Spring2021 branch to thr origin (Ben's MSUDataAnalytics)
Go to netlify and deploy the website (might happen automatically). Make sure to commit .html files as well.
That should update it.

To commit everything, use terminal:

      git commit -a -m "commit message"
      
Use blogdown::hugo_build() which should update the public folders. Those are what Netlify cares about. Make sure all disappear from Git window if committing with -a
Once those are committed and pushed to AJK, netlify will automatically build and deploy within minutes.

+++++++++++++++++++

Remember to NEVER use the PUSH button - that will create and update a fork on Ben's github (ugh).

Not sure what happens if you use "pull" - will it overwrite local files with the non-existent Spring2021 branch on Ben's? If there is no Spring2021 branch on Ben's, then it will jsut 
give an error.




+++ Ben's code does not call dplyr::select. Ugh.
detach("package:dplyr")
library(dplyr)
