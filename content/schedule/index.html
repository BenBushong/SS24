<p>Below is a roadmap for the semester. Note that this will inevitably change from the first day you access this course. However, whatever is listed below should be considered canon.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the syllabus, the course is structured by each week. Every week has three important sections.</p>
<div id="ab-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>A/B Structure</h3>
<p>The class is structured by dividing the student roster into two subsets, forming a “Tuesday” group and a “Thursday” group. Your assigned group dictates when you come to class. In class, we will have a short, practical lecture and an activity which is designed to give you hands-on experience and give you a greater understanding of the broader material. Out of class, you will complete readings and will watch (short) recorded lectures on the week’s topic. Each week is intended to be self contained — the fact you are doing something on Tuesday rather than Thursday or vice versa will not hurt you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings and recorded lectures for the topic.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/example/"><strong>Example</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains <code>R</code> code that we will discuss in-class. These examples are intended as a useful reference to various functions that you will need on weekly labs and in your group project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Labs</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for either the Lab (1–3 brief tasks), or for the two mini projects and final project. <strong>Assignments are due by 11:59 PM (Eastern) on the day they’re listed.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: You should follow this general process each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to class on your assigned day</li>
<li>Do everything on the content (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>) page</li>
<li>Glance through the example (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>) page</li>
<li>Complete the lab (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>).</li>
</ul>
