<p>Below is a roadmap for the semester. Note that this will inevitably change from the first day you access this course. However, whatever is listed below should be considered canon.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the syllabus, the course is structured by each week. Every week has three important sections.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The class is structured with three distinct bits. First, the Tuesday lecture will give an overview of the topic for the week. Next, the Thursday lecture will have a short, practical lecture and an activity which is designed to give you hands-on experience and a greater understanding of the broader material. Finally, you will complete weekly writings (short) and labs (also short; requiring coding in <code>R</code>). Out of class, you will complete readings and can watch (short) recorded lectures on the week’s topic. Note, though, that you are not required to view supplemental recorded videos.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings and recorded lectures for the topic. These pages should be read completely. Lectures are <em>not</em> an exact replication of the written content; on the contrary, the lectures are intended to keep you focused on the high-level ideas, while the readings are broader and more comprehensive. Accordingly, lectures are shorter than the (often quite lengthy) written content.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/example/"><strong>Examples</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page the material that we will discuss in Thursday classes. In addition to teaching specific content, there are many more <code>R</code> code examples. These are intended as a useful reference to various functions that you will need when working on (nearly) weekly labs and your group project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Assignments</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for the weekly lab (1–3 brief tasks) and for the two mini projects + final project. <strong>Labs are due by 11:59 PM (Eastern) on the Monday after they’re posted.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="lab-hours-ta" class="section level3">
<h3>Lab Hours (TA)</h3>
<p>The teaching assistant for this course (Anh Do; <a href="mailto:doanh@msu.edu" class="email">doanh@msu.edu</a>) will host a (very short) supplemental lecture each week to help promote additional understanding. This will be followed by (or preceeded by) open Q&amp;A about the week’s content. I highly encourage you to utilize this resource, especially if you struggle with basic <code>R</code> programming.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: You should follow this general process (in order) each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do everything on the content (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>) page before Tuesday</li>
<li>Come to the lecture on Tuesday.</li>
<li>While “in class” on Thursday, work through the example (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>) page</li>
<li>Complete the lab (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>) and the weekly writing (assigned in class) before the next Tuesday.</li>
<li>As needed, attend the lab hours hosted by the TA.</li>
</ul>
