<h3>Weekly Writing</h3>
<p>This week, your task is to write a short description (approximately one paragraph) that <strong>describes the workflow</strong> of building training data, building a simple model, then refining that model using either forward selection or a shrinkage method. In short: imagine you were explaining this to your cousin who is a freshman at MSU. Give a basic primer.</p>
