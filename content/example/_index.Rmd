This section contains some annotated `R` code that you can use as a reference for creating your own work. In the content section, you sequentially build up your understanding of `R` and data analytics; here you can see how all the pieces work together.

Visit this section after you have finished the readings in the "content" section and any lecture videos.

Many of the examples also contains videos of me live coding so you can see what it looks like to work with `R` in real time.^[I tend to edit these videos for length and because I like to talk to myself when I'm programming. Also, too much swearing.] Hopefully, you'll find it useful to watch the practice of coding. You'll also notice me make all sorts of errors. This is normal. If you're finding yourself making lots of errors and generally struggling to get your code to run, start by working with the final code and reverse-engineer the solution you want.
