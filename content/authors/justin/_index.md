I am an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University in the Department of Economics. I have not yet filled this whole form out, so check back later. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics from Duke University, a M.E.M. in Environmental Economics and Policy also from Duke University, and a B.S. in Environmental Policy Analysis and City Planning from the University of California at Davis.
