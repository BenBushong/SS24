**NOTE**

You must turn in a PDF document of your `R markdown` code. Submit this to D2L by 11:59 PM on Monday.

## Preliminaries
As always, we will first have to load ``ggplot2``. To do this, we will load the tidyverse by running this code:

```
library(tidyverse)
```

## Background

The New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) maintains a list of construction sites that have been categorized as "essential" during the city's shelter-in-place pandemic order. They've provided [an interactive map here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/html/essential-active-construction.html) where you can see the different projects. There's also a link there to download the complete dataset.

For this exercise, you're going to use this data to visualize the amounts or proportions of different types of essential projects in the five boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island).

As you hopefully figured out by now, you'll be doing all your `R` work in `R Markdown`. You can use an RStudio Project to keep your files well organized (either on your computer or on RStudio.cloud), but this is optional. If you decide to do so, either create a new project for this exercise only, or make a project for all your work in this class.

You'll need to download one CSV file and put it somewhere on your computer or upload it to RStudio.cloud---preferably in a folder named `data` in your project folder. You can download the data from [the DOB's map](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/html/essential-active-construction.html), or use this link to get it directly:

- [<i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> `EssentialConstruction.csv`](/projects/02-lab/data/EssentialConstruction.csv)

To help you, I've created a skeleton `R Markdown` file with a template for this exercise, along with some code to help you clean and summarize the data. Download that here and use it to begin your lab this week. Note: skip this step at your own peril.

### R Markdown

(We learned after the first assignment the following.) Many of you have not worked with `R Markdown` before. That's okay---we'll teach you. Importantly, there are resources [here](/resource/) to help.

Writing regular text with `R Markdown` follows the rules of Markdown. You can make lists; different-size headers, etc. This should be relatively straightfoward; consult the resouces for more information.

You'll also need to insert your own code chunks where needed. Rather than typing them by hand (that's tedious and you might miscount the number of backticks!), use the "Insert" button at the top of the editing window, or type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on macOS.

```{r insert-chunk-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="19%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/assignments/insert-chunk-button.png", error = FALSE)
```

__Exercise 1: Essential pandemic construction__

Make the following plots and briefly explain what they show. Note that the included .Rmd file above provides some intial guidance.

1. Show the count or proportion of approved projects by borough using a bar chart.

2. Show the count or proportion of approved projects by category using a lollipop chart

3. Show the proportion of approved projects by borough and category simultaneously using a heatmap

You don't need to make these super fancy, but if you're feeling brave, experiment with adding a `labs()` layer or changing fill colors with `scale_fill_manual()` or with palettes.

__Bonus__

Overlay the data from Part 1 above onto a map of NYC. For double bonus, color the boroughs.

## Turning everything in

When you're all done, click on the "Knit" button at the top of the editing window and create a PDF. If you haven't already [install **tinytex**](/resource/install/#install-tinytex)) to ensure that works. Upload the PDF file to D2L.
