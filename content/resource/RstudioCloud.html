<p>Installing R and RStudio locally (on your computer) is the preferred method. Additionally, most MSU computer labs have R and RStudio installed. However, if your computer isn’t able to run RStudio, or you run into errors that we can’t troubleshoot, using RStudio Cloud is a viable alternative. Hosted at <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">Rstudio.cloud</a>, RStudio Cloud is an online, web-based version of R and RStudio. On the “pro” side, it doesn’t require anything of your system except a functioning browser and can be up and running in a few minutes. The “con”, though, is that you must have an internet connection to use it, and it is limited to 25 hours per month for the free account (and $5/month for up to 75 hours per month). You shouldn’t need more than 25 hours per month, but if you’re very new to coding, it’s possible you will.</p>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The “Files” tab in the lower-right pane shows your cloud project storage space. Let’s add a <code>templates</code> folder and store the two course assignment templates there.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="/assignment/">assignments</a>, scroll down, and <strong>right-click on the Weekly Writing template and select “Save As…”</strong> and save it to your desktop</li>
<li>Do the same for the Lab Assignment template. Clicking on the link will open the text of the file in a browser window and you cannot just copy the text into an R file.</li>
<li>With the files on your computer, go back to RStudio.cloud and in the Files tab, click on “New Folder” and name it <code>templates</code></li>
<li>Upload the templates one at a time to the folder.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the green up arrow to navigate the “Files” tab back to your main directory and create a folder for <code>Labs</code> and one for <code>Weekly Writings</code>.</li>
<li>Open the Lab Assignment template</li>
<li>At the top of the template in the upper-left pane, you’ll see a warning that RStudio needs to install some packages. <strong>Click “Install”</strong></li>
</ol>

<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>After R finishes installing packages (less than a minute), click the “Knit” button on the toolbar.</li>
<li>RMarkdown will need to install a few more packages. Click “Yes”.</li>
</ol>

<li>A pop-up window will open showing you the PDF of the rendered template. Congrats, you are ready to get to work!</li>
